<p class="ph3">Miss Ayr of Virginia</p>
</div>


<p>When Miss Ayr of Virginia came
down to take her place on the coach for
the races, in company with her cousins,
the Miss Ayrs of New York, there was
a discrepancy between the former and the
latter which could scarcely have failed to
attract attention. It could not be denied
that the advantage was on the side of the
last-named ladies, though Miss Ayr of
Virginia was exquisite, and they were
plain.</p>

<p>Compared with such costumes as they
wore, however, such <i>chic</i>, such height, such
distinguished bearing, what was mere
beauty? The little country girl, with her
village-made costume, just saved from absolute
dowdiness by a few touches from
her cousins’ maid (which she had inwardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
resented), was certainly a fish out of water
in that jaunty party; and in her wretched
little soul she felt it.</p>

<p>Moreover, her dress was not only
countrified, it was unbecoming. Its style
of construction quite disguised her slight
and charming figure, and her hat was as
complete a handicap for a beautiful face as
could well have been invented.</p>

<p>She did not realize this, not having as
yet entirely lost her buoyant belief in herself,
which was one result of her being an
only child and the spoiled darling of her
father, besides being the recognized belle
of her county. What she did realize,
however, was that these fashionable cousins
of hers found her a nuisance, and that
the invitation which she had received from
their father would never have come from
themselves.</p>

<p>The Miss Ayrs of New York were
partly right in what they said of their
cousin, namely, that she had been badly
brought up. This fact might possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
have been overlooked on the score of her
having lost her mother in childhood, but
for the other fact, that the Miss Ayrs of
New York were in the same case, and
yet felt proudly conscious that they could
challenge the world as to their unimpeachable
good form. There was one important
difference between the two families,
however. The Ayrs of New York were
rich, while the Ayrs of Virginia were
poor. The war, which had caused the
impoverishment of the latter branch of
the family was not yet so far back in the
past but that days of opulence and ease
could yet be remembered, even by this
sole representative in the present generation,
Miss Carter Ayr, who, now for the
first time emerged from the safety and
seclusion of her beloved South, was come
to taste the delights of a season in New
York.</p>

<p>The two brothers, who were the respective
heads of the families, had both
been left widowers, and neither of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
had re-married; but John Ayr of New
York had been able to give his daughters
the very best that money could do for
them, in the way of governesses and
chaperonage and foreign travel, while
Henry Ayr of Virginia had had to content
himself with the ministrations of a
gentle, old-maid cousin, who had been
governess and chaperon in one, and had
let Carter grow up much as she chose—a
fact which had not in the least interfered
with her father’s complete satisfaction
with her.</p>

<p>There were three Miss Ayrs of New
York, and they were all tall, and imposing,
and perfectly dressed. They were particularly
showy for an occasion such as
the present, which was, perhaps, one reason
why Jim Stafford, the young bachelor millionaire
to whom all society did reverence,
had invited all three of them to go out on
his coach to-day. Jim was a very good-natured
fellow, however, and often did
things with no other prompting than that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
quality, and so, when Mr. Ayr, hearing
the matter discussed over night, and no
provision made for Carter, had insisted
that one of the girls should yield her place
to her cousin, Jim had good-naturedly
said there was room for all, and Mr. Ayr
had decreed that Carter should go. He
generally interfered very little, but his
daughters knew that when he spoke he
meant to be obeyed.</p>

<p>So, in this way, it happened that little
Carter Ayr found herself in the midst of
that fluttering, chattering, bantering party,
whose jargon was wholly unfamiliar, and
whose manner toward herself seemed to
surround her with an atmosphere of chill
and constraint.</p>

<p>As the female element was so largely
supplied by the ladies Ayr, most of the
strangers whom Carter saw about her were
men. She had never seen such men as
these before, except in a tailor’s picture-plate,
and she felt rather a contempt for
them, as country-bred people are apt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
feel toward those who dress as they have
neither the means nor the knowledge to
dress. Carter, with her provincial prejudice
against fastidiousness in dress, particularly
on the part of men, now got some
sense of inward support by adopting a
supercilious criticism of the exquisitely
cared for details of the costumes of these
men. She had a standard in her little
Southern heart by which she liked to believe
that she measured these fashionable
gentlemen into puniness.</p>

<p>In spite of all her loyalty to a very different
type, she could not help feeling
lonely and depressed, as she was assisted
to mount to her high seat, while the grooms
could hardly keep in check the impatience
of the four superbly harnessed horses.
Carter, who knew the points of a horse,
thought the harness rather outdid the
horses themselves, but what did her opinion
amount to in this company, where
she was so evidently a supernumerary and
an incubus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>It was an uncommonly pretty foot that
she put on the ladder to mount, but it had
on a very bad shoe. Even the big and
clumsy feet of her cousins contrasted favorably
with it, for the reason that their
shoes were of shiny patent leather, with
sharply-pointed toes, which made her little
blunt ones look somehow stunted and
shabby. But then, again, she had reason
to reflect that no one was noticing her!</p>

<p>Who has not felt a certain sense of pity
on festal occasions, for the friend who is
brought? That person seems, somehow,
surrounded with a sort of blight among the
others who have come by a process of
natural selection.</p>

<p>But if any heart, under those fashionable
habiliments, felt a tender sentiment
for Carter, no one showed it. Jim Stafford,
himself, was wholly occupied with
handling the reins, as they drove through
the crowded streets. The Misses Gladys,
Ethel, and Rosamond Ayr were making
themselves as painstakingly agreeable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the men beside them as if it had been
their business to divert attention from all
the others present, and the married woman,
who was acting as chaperon to the party,
was the most cold and unapproachable of
the lot—or so Carter had concluded, when
one of her cousins had given her a casual
introduction to Mrs. Emory, as “Miss
Ayr of Virginia.”</p>

<p>Somehow, the intonation with which it
had been said had given an indefinable
offense to Carter, and when other members
of the party took it up and said:</p>

<p>“Help Miss Ayr of Virginia to her
place,” or “Miss Ayr of Virginia comes
next,” or “Don’t crowd Miss Ayr of
Virginia,” though it was all said in an
amiable way, Carter’s sense of resentment
deepened. There seemed to be a certain
disrespect to her beloved State implied,
and that was more than she could calmly
bear.</p>

<p>It was a new and exciting experience
to her to be whirled through the thronged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
city streets, and gazed at by admiring
crowds, upon whom she looked down from
such a great height that it almost made
her dizzy. If she had been in a congenial
atmosphere, it would have been delightful,
for she was inherently pleasure-loving, and
her blood was young and ardent; but, as
things were, everything seemed to add to
her sense of loneliness and depression.</p>

<p>The sky had been overcast when they
started out, but now, suddenly, the sun
appeared, and with it came a little gleam
across the shadows on Carter’s face. She
had felt bitterly the fact that she was ill-dressed
(though, at home, these clothes
had seemed to her good enough for any
company in the world!) but with the appearance
of the sunshine she had remembered
the one really incontrovertibly handsome
and imposing thing which she possessed—an
elegant parasol, which she
had bought the day before at a very fashionable
place, and for a price which a
week ago would have frightened her. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
father had paid over to her a little legacy
from an aunt, and she had intended to invest
this in jewels or some permanent
thing, but she had heard her cousin Gladys
admire that parasol, and, needing one, she
had boldly purchased it.</p>

<p>So, here, at least, she could be confident,
and it was with an air of satisfaction that
she now unfurled her gorgeous sun-shade,
and let the full glory of its laces and ribbons
float to the breeze.</p>

<p>The motion that it made attracted general
attention to her, and simultaneously
with this she heard Gladys say, in a voice
of excited protest:</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, tell Carter to put
down that parasol!”</p>

<p>The word was then passed to Ethel,
who, in the same excited tone, passed it
to the man seated next to Carter.</p>

<p>“Miss Ayr of Virginia is requested to
lower her parasol,” he said, with more
amiability in his manners than her two
cousins had used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Carter, who had heard the behest, when
it had originated with her eldest cousin,
did not at once succumb, but said, from
under the flaunting glory of the proscribed
article:</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Of course, coming from Virginia she
didn’t know,” she heard her cousin saying
in a tone of contemptuous extenuation,
which she hotly resented.</p>

<p>No one had answered her question,
however, and so turning to the woman
who sat nearest to her—it happened to be
Mrs. Emory—she said:</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I raise my parasol, if
the sun is out?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t done,” was the answer, given
curtly and coldly, and Mrs. Emory returned
at once to her talk with her neighbor.</p>

<p>Carter, of course, furled her offending
sun-shade, feeling snubbed and sore. It
would have been childish and rude to persist,
but she was not only hurt, but puzzled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Being from the rural regions she
had not as her cousin suggested, any
knowledge of the fact that it was not considered
smart to raise a parasol on a
coach. This sacred tenet was so strictly
adhered to, however, that although it was
a warm and dusty autumn day, the ladies
endured the heat unmurmuringly, staring
with haughty superiority at the coaches on
which the people were pleasantly shaded
by their parasols.</p>

<p>By the time the entrance to the race-course
was reached, Carter was completely
miserable. She despised the trivial
conventions to which she saw such importance
attached, and she had a sense of
suppressed rage at being forced into an inferior
position by people to whom she felt
herself superior.</p>

<p>She was no more conceited than an
only child, and an acknowledged belle and
beauty might be excused for being, and she
did know, in her heart, that she would
have been incapable of treating the meanest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
slave on her father’s estate as unkindly
as she felt that these people were treating
her.</p>

<p>No one noticed her as they went bowling
along in the crowded procession of
vehicles, until, near the entrance, they came
to a sudden halt, the carriage in front of
them having halted also.</p>

<p>The footmen sprang down and went to
the leaders’ heads, while necks were craned
and eager questions put as to the cause of
the blockade.</p>

<p>It was apparent enough. One of a
pair of oxen, engaged in some heavy
draught in connection with the preparing
of the track and grounds, had fallen down,
or else thrown itself down in a fit of sullenness
and could not be got to move.
The animal was strong and fat, and looked
more obstinate than ill, but it was impossible
not to feel pity for a creature so
beaten and belabored and kicked, as it
was, by the men about it. The thing had
apparently been going on for some time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and the men looked as if their efforts were
well-nigh exhausted.</p>

<p>Various suggestions were made and tried
in vain. Many vehicles had emptied their
passengers, and a crowd had gathered,
while the ox, stubborn and defiant, still refused
to budge.</p>

<p>The party on the coach, from their high
position, could see all that was happening,
and cries of distress soon began to rise
from them.</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” “The creature
hasn’t a notion of moving!” “We shall
be kept here all day!” were some of the
protesting remarks, through which a very
sweetly modulated voice, with an accent so
unlike theirs as to sound almost foreign,
was heard to say:</p>

<p>“I could make it get up, in half a minute.”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried Jim Stafford,
turning toward the speaker, who was
flushed, but perfectly composed. “Virginia
to the rescue! Miss Ayr of Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
undertakes to raise the stalled ox! Ten
to one she does it!”</p>

<p>The bet was eagerly taken by another
man, and Carter found herself the center
of interest.</p>

<p>“Enter the field, Miss Ayr of Virginia,”
said Jim Stafford. “Only explain
your method of procedure, and I’m your
backer. What do you propose to do?”
And with the arrant childishness of the
average pleasure-seeker all the men present
became absorbed in this incident, which
offered a new and unexpected diversion.</p>

<p>All the women, meantime, were looking
at the young Southern girl with cold
disapprobation.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Ayr of Virginia,” said
Jim Stafford, “give your orders. How
do you propose to do it?”</p>

<p>“Could we possibly get some mud from
anywhere?” asked Carter.</p>

<p>“Mud? not likely, in this dust!” said
one man, but Stafford cut him short.</p>

<p>“Mud? Of course. Nothing simpler!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
he said. “Here, Trollope, get a
bottle of Apollinaris out of the lunch-basket
and break it in the road;” and as
the groom flew to comply with his order
he turned to Carter.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the mud in a jiffy,” he
said. “Now, what’s to be done with it?”</p>

<p>“Stop the ox’s nostrils with it,” Carter
decreed next.</p>

<p>The young dudes on the coach gave a
little “Hooray!” and in a moment they
were down in the road, stirring the fizzing
water into the yellow dust with their
canes, with all the glee of children at a
new game.</p>

<p>The mixture was soon turned into a
stiff mud, and the immaculate Trollope
was ordered to fill his hands with it and
follow his master.</p>

<p>Every eye was fixed on Jim Stafford, as
he approached the man who had the ox
in charge and ask permission to try his
experiment. Carter, left on the coach
with the women, who she felt, instinctively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
were not the friendly element of the
party, watched with a confidence not unmixed
with anxiety. How could she tell
that these Yankee oxen would respond
to Virginia treatment? And if they did
not, where would she hide her humiliated
head? She realized that, like many
another act of daring, its only justification
would be in its success.</p>

<p>“Stop up both nostrils at once, and
hold it in,” she called to Trollope, in her
pretty, low voice.</p>

<p>The crowd made way for the groom
and his master to approach, and the performance
was quickly accomplished.</p>

<p>The next instant, there was a heaving
and panting on the part of the ox, and,
with a frantic motion of consternation, it
had scrambled to its feet, and stood there
snorting out the mud and shaking its
great head from side to side.</p>

<p>The man in charge of it caught hold of
its harness, and without the least difficulty,
led it away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The road was open.</p>

<p>“Three times three for Miss Ayr of
Virginia!” cried Jim Stafford, and his companions,
imitating him, waved their hats
around their heads and echoed his words.</p>

<p>It was not loud enough to be positively
rowdy, but it was too loud, it seemed, to
suit Mrs. Emory’s sense of decorum, for
she was heard to say rather severely:</p>

<p>“Really, Jim, if you ask me to chaperon
your parties, I must insist upon
decent behavior. This is unbearable!”
and she turned upon poor little Carter a
glance that was meant to be perfectly annihilating.</p>

<p>“Get out, Mamie! You’re making a
point about nothing,” her cousin answered,
in an amiable, off-hand fashion. “If
you’d been the heroine of that incident,
you’d think you deserved cheers and
you’d have had them. I’m not going to
see Miss Ayr of Virginia deprived of the
honor and glory which are her due.”</p>

<p>His cousin said nothing, but her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
continued to look both offended and
aggrieved, and she turned away to speak
with some of the women of the party,
who seemed promptly sympathetic.</p>

<p>Carter heard her name pronounced
several times among them in a tone which
she did not like, and it was Gladys whom
she distinctly heard saying:</p>

<p>“This is what comes of giving a girl a
man’s name and letting her run wild, as
they do in the South.”</p>

<p>Carter felt indignant at the aspersion
cast on her beloved South, but the assiduities
which she was at that moment receiving
from all the men in the party
helped her to bear it.</p>

<p>It was not altogether her victoriousness
in her recent undertaking that had made
them rally round her so. It had at last
penetrated their rather slow minds that
the women were exercising a sort of tacit
ostracism against this young stranger, and
every one of them was ready with his
protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Carter, moreover, had acquired a brilliant
color, by reason of her late experience,
and, now that their eyes had been drawn
to her directly, they saw how uncommonly
pretty she was, and regarded her unfashionable
garments with a commiseration
that had something akin to chivalry in it.
She felt this, and, under the influence of
sympathy, her beauty blossomed out like
a flower. She became suddenly gay and
at her ease. The men were so absolutely
friendly that the women no longer frightened
her.</p>

<p>When Jim Stafford had brought his
four bays triumphantly into place and
they had taken their position by the
race-course, the grooms took the horses
away, and the host of the party being
liberated from his exacting duties as
whip, was free to seek his own will and
pleasure.</p>

<p>It was not long before the nature and
direction of that became manifest, for he
deliberately proposed a shuffling of seats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and partners, by which he managed to seat
himself next to Carter.</p>

<p>“I want to understand the philosophy
of that splendid achievement of yours,” he
said. “Why did the mud make the ox jump
up so quickly?”</p>

<p>“Because the mud stopped its nostrils
and it could not breathe.”</p>

<p>“But can’t oxen breathe through their
mouths?”</p>

<p>“They either can’t, or they think they
can’t, for they never make any effort to
do it. It was having its breathing suddenly
checked that so startled and terrified
the creature that it instinctively sprang to
its feet, and its whole mood was changed.”</p>

<p>“And where—if one may ask—did you
become the possessor of such a unique and
valuable piece of information?”</p>

<p>(By Jove, she <i>was</i> pretty, he reflected,
and particularly so at that moment, when,
for some reason, a flood of lovely rose-color
suffused her face.)</p>

<p>“A neighbor of ours told me about it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
she said. “I am glad I happened to
think of it.”</p>

<p>“I should think so, indeed! But for
that timely thought of yours, we should
probably have spent the day there, awaiting
that brute’s pleasure!”</p>

<p>He knew that this was not so, but he
suddenly found himself possessed of a consuming
desire to do homage to this girl.</p>

<p>And to tell the truth, she looked not
unused to homage. Indeed, she was far
more natural and at her ease, now that she
was being made much of and paid court to,
than she had been, when neglected and left
alone. There could be no doubt as to
which of these conditions was her accustomed
element.</p>

<p>When the racing began, the general interest
centered on the track, of course, and
as the different horses were led out, Carter
showed and expressed such a knowingness
on the subject that all the men listened
with visible interest to what she had to
say. The remarks of the other women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sounded the merest <i>banalités</i> in comparison,
for this little country maiden knew a
horse as she knew a friend.</p>

<p>She was wildly excited over the first
race, and had the good fortune to pick
out the winner. As a consequence,
the men all insisted on her betting on the
second one, putting up gloves and candy
recklessly. To their surprise, their overtures
were promptly snubbed, the little
Virginian looking so hurt at such a proposition
that her big eyes showed a suspicion of
tears. The other ladies of the party,
however, took up the bets with avidity,
though their opportunities were decidedly
more limited.</p>

<p>At last the great race of the day was
called. A grey horse named Quicksilver
was the hot favorite in it, and was to be
ridden by a colored jockey. This last fact
caught Carter’s attention, and sent her
thoughts flying wistfully Southward, and
she was further interested because he wore
the Confederate colors—white and red.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
She could not see his face, but it was easy
to distinguish the silver-grey horse, and, to
her delight, it came in first, though pushed
hard by another horse named Hautboy.</p>

<p>The second heat was even more exciting,
for now Quicksilver came tearing
along the home stretch, neck and neck with
Hautboy.</p>

<p>The two ran together superbly, their
jockeys poised like birds upon their backs,
but just before the judges’ stand was
reached, there was a wild plunging and
collision, and Hautboy came in ahead.</p>

<p>And then began a scene of frantic excitement.
The little mulatto who had
ridden Quicksilver was in a state of fury,
bordering upon insanity. He vowed that
Hautboy’s jockey had used some trickery,
and appealed to the judges, who refused
to sustain him. At this he went simply
beside himself, and tossing away his whip,
declared he would not ride the other heat.
Threats, expostulations, bribes, oaths,
abusive epithets, coaxing cajoleries were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
used in vain. He was simply maddened
with fury, and stubbornly adhered to his
refusal.</p>

<p>Quicksilver, meanwhile, was being
walked about, switching his tail viciously
and glaring wickedly to right and left.
He was an evil-tempered brute, and this
young darkey was the only rider who
seemed equal to him. Immense sums
had been put up on the race and desperate
measures were resorted to to bring the obstreperous
jockey to his reason.</p>

<p>But it was all in vain. He reiterated
his refusal with excited fury. He said a
million dollars wouldn’t make him ride the
other heat, and that he’d die first.</p>

<p>All this time Carter had been watching
the scene with eagerness, their coach being
very near to the judges’ stand, and now, as
the little darkey, bearing her beloved
Southern colors, turned his defiant face
upward toward the judges’ stand, and she
saw it clearly for the first time, a suspicion,
which had been slowly dawning on her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was turned into reality—a reality that
thrilled her through with excitement.</p>

<p>“He must do it! He shall!” she said,
in a low tone to Jim Stafford. “Take
me down there, and I’ll make him!”</p>

<p>Stafford looked at her aghast. He was
excited enough himself, for the time was
flying, and, with a little more delay, the
race would be declared off.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he said, in one second’s
hesitation, and then, remembering the ox,
he added, “Come on, then, quickly,” and
in another instant she was nimbly descending
the ladder and he was making a
way for her to get to the railing.</p>

<p>The party on the coach stared protestingly,
and Gladys made an effort to recall
her, but little heed paid Carter, as she
found herself close up to the railing,
toward which the colored jockey was
even now advancing, in his defiant resolution
to leave the field.</p>

<p>A dozen men were following him, with
urgent beseechings and threats, to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
he turned an absolutely deaf ear, until
suddenly, across this clamor a soft, clear
voice said, with a ring of command:</p>

<p>“You, Little Tom!”</p>

<p>The darkey turned, as if shot, and
looked the speaker full in the face.</p>

<p>“Get up on that horse this instant!”
said the same clear voice, imperiously.
“Bring him here,” it added, to the man
who was holding Quicksilver’s bridle, and
as the restive animal was brought near, it
suddenly became apparent that the human
creature had been subdued.</p>

<p>The bewildered jockey stared full at
the young lady before him, and when she
said:</p>

<p>“Get up—quick, I say! You haven’t
a second to lose.”</p>

<p>The resolute command was immediately
obeyed, and the red-and-white-shirted
jockey was on the horse and in his place,
five seconds only before the order to start
was given.</p>

<p>Only those in the immediate neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
had seen and heard what passed, and
even they were so preoccupied by the paramount
excitement of the moment, that,
in their eagerness to follow the horses now
flying away down the track, they forgot to
think about the girl who had saved the
day by some occult authority which she
possessed, and so she managed to slip
through the crowd almost unobserved, and
to regain her seat upon the coach, followed
by Stafford in a state of ecstacy over her
success.</p>

<p>Meantime, the horses, like a pack of
hounds, were bunched together on the
other side of the course, but now the grey
could be seen to be steadily gaining, and
soon the red and white colors could be distinguished.
Quicksilver was ahead, and
every instant was an advance for him. As
his slight young rider, leaning forward with
his mount, rose in his stirrups, and rested
in delicate poise, the breeze whipping into
fluttering folds the striped silk of his shirt,
and seeming to blow backward, in its strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
current even Quicksilver’s lowered ears,
the crowd sent up a wild yell of enthusiasm,
in which one alien-sounding voice was
heard exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Good for you, Little Tom!”</p>

<p>The voice was so low, however, that no
one heard it very plainly except Stafford,
and now, as the race ended, with Quicksilver
first, and no second, he turned delightedly
to his companion, saying:</p>

<p>“Good for you, Miss Ayr of Virginia!
It was you who saved the day, and now
will you be good enough to tell me how
you did it? If ever I saw a creature determined
to go his own way and defy consequences,
it was that angry negro, until
you spoke to him, when he came down
like a lamb. How you managed it—(and
without even the aid of mud!)—is what I
want you to explain.”</p>

<p>“O, there is nothing wonderful in it
when you come to find out,” said Carter.
“It’s our Little Tom, who ran off from home
some time ago and his mammy has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
grieving for him ever since. Of course
when I spoke to him, he would not dare
to disobey me.”</p>

<p>“So it appeared,” said Stafford, “though
he did not scruple to disobey and defy a
dozen determined men! I must say I
don’t understand it. And since he is a
grown man, why do you call him ‘Little
Tom,’ may I ask?”</p>

<p>“To distinguish him from the other
Toms on the place,” said Carter. “There
were so many of them—Little Tom, and
Tom, and Uncle Tom, and Old Uncle
Tom, and Old <i>Old</i> Uncle Tom.”</p>

<p>This explanation, which Carter made
so simply, proved immensely amusing to
the men of the party, who laughed and
enjoyed it sufficiently to hide, in part,
the lack of enthusiasm which the ladies
had shown.</p>

<p>Stafford insisted on going and looking
Little Tom up, and bringing him to drink
a glass of champagne in honor of his
triumph. He came, sheepishly enough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
when he heard who had sent for him,
though he had borne himself with a good
deal of swagger in the crowd where Stafford
found him.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Miss Kyarter,” he said, taking
off his cap, and dangling it nervously
in his hands, as he stood on the ground
looking up at her. “I sut’ny is glad tuh
see yuh. Them white folks kinder confused
me ’bout dat race, en mammy ain’
whup all the temper out’er me yit! I
sut’ny is glad you bin come ’long, en mek
me ride. I leet more loss dat money!
En I gwine let yuh tek half of it home wid
yuh, fuh a presen’ tuh mammy.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Little Tom,” said Carter.
“It’ll please mammy mightily. I’m
going to tell her about the race and what
a fine horse you rode.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, he’s right smart fine, Quicksilver
is, but I don’ think he ekills we all’s
Whitefoot. I ain’ see none dese yer
horses dat’s up to Whitefoot <i>yet</i>! Ef
ole Mars’d lemme bring Whitefoot on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
hyar, en ride ’im at a race, he’d beat
’em all, en dat’s what I tell ’em every
time.”</p>

<p>Carter, who was intimately acquainted
with Little Tom’s character and points of
view, smiled to herself at this compliment
to poor old Whitefoot, whose best days
were so far in the past. She knew it was
only done to impress strangers with the
importance of the people to whom, in
spite of his desertion of them for scenes
more congenial to his adventurous spirit,
he was and would always remain loyal.</p>

<p>After this little episode, Carter’s timidity
vanished, and, being the centre of attraction
on the coach now, she felt far
more at her ease, and she talked much
and talked well. But, with it all, her
voice was so low, her speech so gently
modulated, as she told negro anecdotes and
imitated their talk, that her cousins found
nothing to say afterward, except that she
had made herself rather conspicuous, and
Carter, who felt that they would gladly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
have said more, felt that she could well
endure that.</p>

<p>Miss Ayr of Virginia had certainly
been very unfortunate in the specimens of
New York women whom she had so far
encountered, and, being very rash and impulsive,
she must be forgiven for making
the great mistake of judging all New York
women by these cousins of hers and their
associates in “the smart set.” And as a convert
to any faith is always more zealous
and infatuated than those who have been
born to it, so the Miss Ayrs of New York
were the extreme examples of this type.</p>

<p>The little Virginian, who was accustomed
to using her wits, had discovered
one thing during that day’s experience at
the races, which disturbed her very much.
This was that she was badly dressed. It
stung her pride at first to be compelled to
own it, but having done so, she set about
the task of remedying this defect. She
had naturally a genial and affectionate
nature, and her first step was to try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
get some help from her cousins. They,
however, showed so very little interest in
the matter that Carter, who now realized
that she was heavily handicapped by her
dresses and bonnets, was led to believe
that they did not wish to see this disability
removed. This thought hurt her,
at first, and then inspired her to a course
of resolute and independent action.</p>

<p>She knew that her father would be distressed
if she came home suddenly and
gave her real reasons for such a course;
and, besides, she could not travel alone,
and the time which her father had set to
come for her was still weeks off, so she
made up her mind to stay, and to provide
herself with such an outfit as would change
the face of her staying.</p>

<p>Finding her cousins quite indisposed to
give her their aid, she made a note of an
address on the belt of one of their dresses,
and next morning she went to that address
and held a conference with that high authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The woman recognized her as a pretty
subject, and they put their heads together
and got up two charming costumes, one
for street, and the other for evening wear.
The dressmaker happened not to be very
busy, and the dresses were promised in a
few days’ time. Then Carter, who had
taken in a good deal of the prevailing modes
from her yesterday’s experiences, went
boldly, all by herself, and bought a hat, and
gloves, and shoes.</p>

<p>Every moment it was borne in on her
more plainly what a countrified little being
she was, and she felt that if she now got
safely housed once more, she would not
venture out, until she could spread her
wings in her new plumage.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a real regret to her
when she presently encountered Jim Stafford,
immaculately dressed and gloved and
booted, walking down Fifth Avenue with a
bunch of fresh violets in his button-hole
and a smile on his good-natured face,
which deepened into a look of real pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
as he recognized her and lifted his tall
hat.</p>

<p>She would have been quite content to
bow and pass on, but he turned and walked
with her.</p>

<p>“What luck!” he said, in his jolly way.
“Would you believe that I was that
moment thinking of you? The stories
of the ox and the jockey are all over town
to-day, and everybody is wanting to see
you. When will you go out on my coach
again?”</p>

<p>“Not until I get some better clothes
to wear,” said Carter, in her impulsive
way. “I never knew, until yesterday,
how countrified country people are!”</p>

<p>“And who undertook to enlighten you,
I’d like to know?” said her companion,
frowning. “Some spiteful woman, of
course! There’s nothing the matter that
I can see, and if I were you I’d pay no
attention to their criticisms.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t? Then you are
distinctly <i>not</i> me, for I’m mending my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
ways with the utmost rapidity. You
mustn’t ask me to appear again in public,
until I can look like other people.”</p>

<p>“But that’s exactly what I don’t want.
It’s just because you look—and are—unlike
other people that I like you. It
would be a perfect shame for you to be
changed into one of the people you are
going to imitate.”</p>

<p>“Never fear that,” said Carter, with a
sudden seriousness. “We are utterly
different peoples, I think—the North and
the South! I have never been in the
North before, and I feel I’m in a foreign
land.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that! I can’t bear to have
you feeling that way. What could one do
to make you feel at home here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—I verily believe! The South
is in my veins—but I think, in a way,
kindness makes one feel at home everywhere—and
you <i>have</i> been kind to me!”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached her
uncle’s house and she held out her hand as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
if to say good-bye. Her look was so sweet
and winning as he took that little hand,
awkwardly gloved as it was, that he felt an
inward protest at being dismissed.</p>

<p>“Why may I not come in?” he said.</p>

<p>“There’s no one at home,” she answered,
innocently, “the girls were all
going to a tea.”</p>

<p>“Decidedly, I shall come in,” he said,
as he rang the bell. “Why didn’t they take
you to the tea?”</p>

<p>“O, they said they thought I wouldn’t
care for it, and they were right.”</p>

<p>When the servant opened the door and
ushered them into the drawing-room, he
stopped to ask if he should serve tea there.</p>

<p>Carter hesitated a second, but Stafford
said promptly:</p>

<p>“Yes, Thompson, you may. I am
going to get Miss Ayr to give me a cup.”</p>

<p>So in a very few moments Carter found
herself seated before the exquisitely appointed
tea-tray, pouring out a fragrant
cupful, for this pleasant and friendly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
man, who was evidently enjoying himself
thoroughly.</p>

<p>There was an undeniable sense of pleasure
in it. The room was so large and
beautiful and luxurious; Thompson deferred
to her wishes in such an agreeable
manner; the tea was so good; the china
and silver so delicate; the man facing her
was so <i>soigné</i> in all the appointments of his
dress—in short, there was about her everywhere
the sense of ease and luxury which
money alone brings—and Carter had never
cared a rap for money! Her wants had
been so few and small that they had
always been readily supplied; in fact she
had never before imagined the mere material
comfort which it was possible to
miss out of life.</p>

<p>“Do tell me something more about the
darkies,” said her companion, sipping his
tea enjoyingly, when Thompson had gone,
“I’ve been chuckling ever since, over
those stories you told us yesterday.”</p>

<p>Carter knit her pretty brow to try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
think up something. It was very pleasant
to her to try to amuse this amiable
man, for she really felt grateful to him,
and anxious to please him.</p>

<p>“O, I’ll tell you about Uncle Enos,
when he got religion,” she said, smiling at
the remembrance. “It was such a clever
thing in him! Enos was our white-washer,
and he had been notoriously bad
and irreligious, until his conversion. The
very next day he came to me and told me
of it, and added that, early that morning,
while he was white-washing a fence, a
serious danger had threatened him in his
new life. ‘Miss Kyarter,’ he said, ‘I was
wuckin’ away en thinkin’ ’bout de blessed
change whar done bin cum tuh me, en I look
up en see one o’ them miser’ble, low-life,
God-forsaken niggers, whar I had done
bin use tuh keep comp’ny with, a-cummin’
down de road. I see him begin tuh laugh
en sner, ez soon ez he cum nigh me, en I
knowed ’twus kus I done jine de army o’
de Lord. He stop short on t’other side de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
fence, en he low since I bin done got religion,
he s’pose I b’lieve everything de Bible
say is true? I tell him, ‘Yes, bless de
Lord!’ ‘Well,’ he say, with one o’ his
wicked, mischeeveous grins, ‘don’t de
Bible say dat when de Lord done finish
all He wuks, He bin look at ’em all, en
behol’ dey was all good?’ ‘Yes,’ I tell
him, ‘dem is de ve’y words o’ de blessed
book.’ ‘Well,’ he say, ‘didn’ de Lord
mek de <i>Devil</i>? How was dat?’ en he
slaps his impident fat sides en busted out
a-laughin’! He had jiss turn roun’ to go
way, when I call him back. ‘Hol’ on,
you blasphemious black-skinned raskill!’
I say, ‘you think yuh dun kotch me, do
yuh? But wasn’ he a mighty good
<i>Devil</i>?’”</p>

<p>Stafford laughed, with a feeling of
zest that he had not known for a long
while. He was evidently immensely
amused at the negro characteristics, as
Carter unfolded them to him, and the girl,
catching sight of a guitar, tucked away in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
a corner, ran and brought it, in her natural
and impulsive way, and, with her head
prettily turned on one side, began to
tune it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to sing you some plantation
hymns,” she said. “Shall I?”</p>

<p>As he responded with the most evident
enthusiasm, she got her chords attuned
and began to sing to an indescribably
plaintive tune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“O, send down de angel to trouble o’ de water,</div>
<div class="verse">O, send down de angel to trouble o’ de water,</div>
<div class="verse">O, send down de angel to trouble o’ de water,</div>
<div class="indent">And to let God’s saints come in.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Her voice was exquisitely clear and
sweet and she possessed the unusual charm
of looking especially attractive when she
sang. Altogether, the experience was
new to Stafford, and very interesting. To
see that pretty creature, in her country-made
gown, with the hat thrown aside
from her charming head, which it had
roughened into picturesque disorder, singing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
that wistful, yearning tune about
God’s saints, with such an absence of any
self-consciousness, except that she was
giving pleasure, was really a rare delight
to the young man of fashion. His whole
life was the pursuit of pleasure, and he
found it in a very piquant form here.</p>

<p>She sang next a hymn beginning “De
Gospel train am coming roun’ de bend,”
and then passed into the tripping measure
of “Who’ll be de Leader, when de
Bride-Groom comes?” a catching little
air with which he was enchanted.</p>

<p>Altogether he had not been so well entertained
for a long time, and the next
morning came a note asking that Miss
Ayr of Virginia and one of her cousins
would take seats on his coach for an expedition
to be got up in special compliment
to the first-named Miss Ayr.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to her cousins and, as
Carter could see, not a welcome one.
Gladys, being spokesman, said that she
thought it best to mention the fact that, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
her conspicuous seat by the driver, her
costume would be a target for criticism.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind that,” said Carter,
lightly. “Mr. Stafford didn’t ask me for
my clothes.”</p>

<p>“You would feel awkward, I should
think—” began Gladys, but Carter interrupted
her:</p>

<p>“Not a bit, I assure you!” she said.
“I’ll feel as happy as possible.”</p>

<p>She was malicious enough to keep her
secret, and she even suspected some
malice on her cousin’s part, in looking
forward with satisfaction to finding herself
proved to be in the right when the
appointed hour should come.</p>

<p>And when it did come, and Miss Ayr
of Virginia stepped forth arrayed, she was
a charming enough vision to have accounted
for a good deal of feminine envy and
uncharitableness!</p>

<p>The fit of her gown was faultless, and
it was a well-nigh faultless figure which
was fitted. The color was fresh and pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and so were the tints of hair, and eyes, and
lips, and cheeks. The hat was youth
and grace itself, and all smaller details
of her toilet were beyond criticism. She
was a clever creature, this little Miss Ayr
of Virginia, and her present costume gave
ample evidence of it.</p>

<p>When the party was ready to set off,
she was feeling a wonderful sense of
companionship and friendliness with
Stafford, and he with her.</p>

<p>“Stunning, by Jove!” he said, as she
climbed to her place beside him. “It
looks as if Miss Ayr of Virginia was going
to beat them on their own ground. It’s
really almost too bad of you!”</p>

<p>What a pleasant, light-hearted, boyish
creature he was, she thought, and how nice
to be so cordially liked by him and to bowl
along in the place of honor at his side, the
observed and admired of all who passed
them!</p>

<p>And not the least pleasant part of it all
was the sense of <i>bien-être</i>, which came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the consciousness of her irreproachable
costume. It made her feel brave and confident
even with the women of the party,
and, this time, her somewhat timid overtures
to them were far more kindly met.
Gladys, who had elected to be the one of
her cousins to accompany her, treated her
rather differently, she thought, and, altogether,
it was a delightful occasion.</p>

<p>“Are you enjoying yourself?” asked
Stafford, just as this thought was in her
mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, tremendously,” she said.
“For the first time since I got here I am
almost forgetting to be home-sick. Almost,
but not quite.”</p>

<p>“Home-sick?” he said. “I don’t like
that. Why should you be home-sick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve almost died of it,” said Carter.
“The other day, going to the races, on
the line of all those splendid carriages I
saw, at the side of the road, an old horse
eating oats out of a nose-bag, with a ragged
old darkey standing by, and somehow it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
made me think so of home that I almost
burst into tears.”</p>

<p>“But why should you feel so? What
is it that you miss so much that could not
be supplied here?”</p>

<p>“Here? Oh, I could never feel at
home here! What I miss is simply everything—the
earth, and the sky, and the
trees, and the darkies, and the people, and
everything!”</p>

<p>“I should like to see that wonderful
country. Will you let me, some day?”</p>

<p>“Strangers are always welcome in the
South,” she said; “but you would remain
a stranger there. The life would never
suit you.”</p>

<p>She felt instinctively that he did not
like this, and—out of pure compassion
at having hurt a person who had been so
good to her—she set to work to make
herself as delightful to him as she could,
and with such success that Gladys, who
was taking notes from a back seat,
formed a conclusion, which definitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
modified her future course toward her
cousin.</p>

<p>So marked was this that when, at the
end of the excursion, Gladys invited their
late host to come and dine informally that
evening, if he had no other engagement,
and when he had delightedly accepted and
driven away, she followed her little country
cousin to her room and offered in the
pleasantest way to help her out with an
evening toilet.</p>

<p>“I have one, thank you,” Carter said,
“but I’m just as much obliged.”</p>

<p>She hadn’t it in her to bear malice, and
far enough from her consciousness was any
suspicion of the real reason of her cousin’s
change toward her. Had she been present
a few moments later at a conversation
which took place between the three sisters
much light would have been thrown upon
this point. Here Gladys boldly avowed her
belief that Carter would be asked to become
Mrs. Stafford. Never, she said, had
she seen Jim treat any girl as he treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Carter, and without the necessity of much
talk about it, the sisters were unanimously
agreed that it would be a good thing to
have Jim Stafford in the family on any
terms. It was only too evident that there
was no chance of this on terms more close
and acceptable than the present ones, for
his attitude toward the Miss Ayrs of New
York had been strictly limited to the off-hand
intercourse of old friends and neighbors.
And Carter, in her guileless heart,
would never have imagined a further reason
yet. This existed in the fact that Jim
Stafford had been so ardently angled for
by so many of their friends that it would
be a triumph, in a way, to the Ayr girls to
have him even for a cousin. Their thoughts
had gone even farther than that, and they
looked forward to being on cousinly terms
in the establishment over which Jim Stafford’s
wife would preside in New York.</p>

<p>So when Carter came down to dinner
that evening, innocent as a lamb of any
such designs and imaginings as occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the worldly hearts about her, she was received
with great friendliness by her cousins,
and her gown was pronounced “as smart
as possible” by Gladys, “very <i>chic</i>” by
Ethel, and to have “quite a <i>cachet</i>” by
Rosamond.</p>

<p>And indeed it was a charming thing,
and she was a charming thing in it! No
one could have dreamed of such a neck
and such arms, under their former unbeautiful
coverings, and the clear cool
green of her crêpey draperies brought out
the pure tints of skin and hair and eyes.</p>

<p>Jim Stafford, when he came, looked at
her quite adoringly, and nobody could
wonder! One or two others of the bachelor
<i>habitués</i> of the house had been bidden
to the impromptu dinner and Carter drew
all eyes upon herself, with as little volition
and consciousness as a magnet.</p>

<p>After dinner, Stafford got hold of the
guitar and beguiled her into the library,
and she sang to him about God’s saints
and the gospel train and the Bridegroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
until every other member of the party followed
and gathered around her.</p>

<p>This was more agreeable to Carter,
perhaps, than to her companion, for he
found any further <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her impossible,
and, to make up for it, he asked
her, on leaving, if he could see her to-morrow
at some appointed hour. She
said yes, certainly, and fixed the time.
Gladys, who happened to be standing not
far off, heard this.</p>

<p>When Carter went to her room that
night, she looked long, and with great
satisfaction at the image which the cheval
glass reflected. She knew that she was
pretty, but, indeed, she had never dreamed
that she could look so charming as this.
Money was a wonderful thing, and she
would not be able in the future to wear
such clothes as these, and she did like
them! She liked admiration, too, and to-night
she had had it unstintedly. Whence
was it, then, that came this sense of lack,
of wanting, of imperfectness? She felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
it, to a degree that positively oppressed
her, and as she doffed her brave attire and
made herself ready for bed she could
scarcely keep the tears out of her eyes.
Two, at least, refused to be suppressed
and lay wet upon her cheek as she finally
fell asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, when she joined her
three cousins in their upstairs sitting-room,
a very smiling welcome greeted her.</p>

<p>“We were just talking of you, Carter,”
Gladys said, “and of how well you looked
last night. Jim Stafford thought so, evidently!
And, by the way, we were wondering
how much you really know about
Jim Stafford.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know a great deal,” Carter answered.
“Very little, in fact, except that
he is very kind and nice; and also, as I
hear, very rich.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how rich?” said Gladys,
with solemnity.</p>

<p>“No! How should I?” said Carter,
looking rather wondering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“I don’t know myself,” said Gladys,
“but it’s a great many millions in money;
besides a superb house, horses, carriages,
pictures, and all sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“And a house at Newport,” put in Ethel,
“a simply magnificent place!”</p>

<p>“And a yacht that is absolute perfection!”
said Rosamond.</p>

<p>“And a collection of pearls of all colors,
set in bracelets, necklaces and rings, which
he has been collecting for years as a wedding
present for his wife,” said Gladys
with grave ardor.</p>

<p>Indeed, the solemnity of all these announcements
seemed to Carter so funny
that she said with a little laugh:</p>

<p>“What are you all so serious about?
There does not seem to me anything profoundly
solemn in all this.”</p>

<p>“The subject of Jim Stafford is more
serious than you realize, perhaps,” said
Gladys. “I think it best to tell you that
we all think that he is going to make you
an offer of marriage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Carter looked from one to the other
with genuine surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” she said, and the
next minute a crimson flush suffused her
face, and she added in a tone of indignation,
“If there is the least chance of such
a thing it must be prevented.”</p>

<p>“Prevented!” said three voices at once
in different tones of surprise and protest.</p>

<p>“Yes—prevented,” Carter said. “I
like him too much to want to hurt his
feelings, and if what you say is so, he
must be stopped before he goes farther.”</p>

<p>“Carter Ayr,” said Gladys, in a tone of
voice thoroughly provoked, “I’d like to
know what you are thinking of and what
you expect! You Southern people do
act as if you owned the earth! What
prospects in life have you got to make
you throw away such a chance as this—the
most brilliant marriage that any girl
here could hope to make! If Jim Stafford
asks you to marry him—as I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
he will—I’ll not believe it that you’ll be
such an idiot as to refuse him.”</p>

<p>Carter rose to her feet, and flashed upon
her a pair of angry eyes.</p>

<p>“Why should I not refuse him?” she
said. “There is but one cause for marriage,
and that does not here exist. Do
you, for an instant, suppose that I, my
father’s daughter, one of the Ayrs of
Virginia, would marry a man for his <i>millions</i>,
and his <i>houses</i>, and his <i>yachts</i>, and his
<i>pearls</i>?”</p>

<p>She hit these several objects off, with a
tone which seemed to turn them into chips,
and blocks, and sawdust, and shavings,
and then, with a sudden softening of all
her face, a sudden lowering of her
voice and another blush, she said, as she
sank back into her seat:</p>

<p>“Besides—to settle the matter at once—I
am engaged.”</p>

<p>“Engaged!” said her cousins together,
and Gladys added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“To whom, pray? Some neighbor in
Virginia?”</p>

<p>Then, once more, Carter sprang to her
feet, and stood there palpitating, as she
said:</p>

<p>“Yes—to a neighbor in Virginia!—a
man whose only earthly possession is a
small farm, which is all that is left of a
great estate. But he is a man, and not a
dude—and he works, instead of playing,
and has paid off thousands of dollars of
debts which he did not make, working day
and night for the money, which, after all,
is less than you are accustomed to see
thrown away at a day’s racing! He is
not fashionable, and you would scorn his
looks and his dress, too, as you did mine,
if he were to come among you—but he is
handsomer and stronger than any man I’ve
seen here—and dearer and better than any
man in all the world! Do you think I’d
give up such a man as that for <i>money</i>?”
(accentuated as if it had been <i>dirt</i>!)
“You don’t know him, you don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
me, you don’t know Virginia if you can
think that! I like Mr. Stafford, and I
hope you are wrong in what you think; but
if not, I believe he would understand me,
whether you do or not.”</p>

<p>“Carter,” said her cousin, insistently,
“are you going to be fool enough to
throw away such a chance as this, for the
sake of a mere school-girl’s sentiment?
You can’t play fast and loose, after your
Southern fashion, with a man like Jim
Stafford. If you throw him aside to-day,
you can’t count on getting him back.”</p>

<p>Carter’s eyes were fairly blazing. She
moved toward the door, but before she
passed it, she turned, and said proudly:</p>

<p>“What I have to say to Mr. Stafford is
my own affair and his. You would not
understand, but he, I think, would.”</p>

<p>What she said to him was simply this
(and he gave her occasion to say it, two
minutes after she came down to see him,
dressed in one of her homely little Virginia
gowns):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Don’t say any more, Mr. Stafford,
please. You have been so good to me,
and I like you so much that I can’t bear
to make you sorry, but I’m engaged to
be married to a man in Virginia, whom I
love with all my heart, and so that settles
it.”</p>

<p>It settled it simply and at once for the
poor young fellow, but he took it hard.
New York saw him no more that season,
and when Carter was married in the
spring his magnificent collection of pearls
was sent to Virginia with a note which
implored her to take them as a wedding
present, and said that unless she consented
to wear them, no other woman ever should.</p>

<p>He believed it, poor fellow, but Carter
didn’t. That was the only thing that
comforted her as she stood, with her
lover’s arm around her waist, turning over
the splendid jewels.</p>

<p>“Of course they must go back,” she
said, “but not just yet. I can’t bear to
hurt him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Poor, poor fellow!” was her companion’s
response, spoken in tones of
heart-felt commiseration, “what a beggar
he is, with all his millions, and how criminally
rich I feel!”</p>

<p class="ph3">A New Thing Under the Sun</p>
</div>

<p>During the months of summer Belton
was usually crowded with city guests, but
the last of these departed, as a rule, with
the falling leaves, and by the time winter
had set in the little town had relapsed
into its normal monotony.</p>

<p>One year, however, there was an exception,
and Mrs. Bryan, who had pleasant
accommodations in her large, old-fashioned
house, received, for a stay understood
to be indefinite, a city boarder, who
arrived in midwinter, and took two of her
best rooms at the highest summer rates.</p>

<p>This lady was duly indorsed and recommended—as
Mrs. Bryan’s boarders
were required to be—in spite of the fact
that she was coming with the avowed purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of getting a divorce from her husband.</p>

<p>The new arrival—Mrs. Leith—proved
to be young and exceedingly pretty. All
her simple, dark costumes were made in
the highest fashion, and had the names of
the best French dressmakers on their
linings. She was an extremely small
woman, exquisitely made, and with minutely
perfect hands and feet. She had with
her an immense Angora cat, and an old
negro servant-woman, who had been her
nurse. Her companions are mentioned
in the order of their estimation in Mrs.
Leith’s regard. The great, white, sleepy,
selfish, unresponsive cat was her very
idol; and the old negress, who loved and
watched over and toiled and suffered for
her, was taken little account of, and even,
at times, made the object of unreasonable
and unjust irritation. But “Mauma,” as
her mistress called her, cared nothing
whatever for that. The days of slavery
were over, but she was held by chains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
more binding and restrictive than any that
they could forge or break.</p>

<p>This old woman had an immense power
of reserve, and her lips were sealed as to
any revelations concerning the past life
of her young mistress. Mrs. Bryan, however,
made a few notes from her own
observation. She noticed, for instance,
that Mrs. Leith always looked forward to
the coming of the mail with an eager interest,
and that, no matter what letters
were received, the expression of her face
was always the same—disappointment.
She wrote few letters, herself, and seemed
to take little interest in those that she got.
Mrs. Bryan came to know, moreover, that
on the not infrequent occasions when Mrs.
Leith would excuse herself from coming to
meals, the cause was generally a fit of crying
which, no doubt, gave rise to the headache
which Mauma would name as her
excuse. Once or twice, when Mrs. Bryan
had accidentally got a glimpse of the inner
room, where she had gone to make inquiries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
she had seen the same picture—the
old negress in a big rocking-chair before
the fire, in her arms her young
mistress, dressed in a little silk dressing-gown
that looked like a baby’s long frock.
Mauma was rocking her backward and
forward, patting and soothing her, while
the poor little creature clung around
her neck and sobbed.</p>

<p>The one real interest in Mrs. Leith’s
life was Fleecy, the Angora cat; and
when, at rare intervals, she chose to show
off her accomplishments, and catch the
rubber ball her mistress rolled on the floor
and bring it to her, Mrs. Leith would
grow gay, and laugh until her cheeks
were flushed with a rosy and becoming
color. Mrs. Bryan had sometimes watched
this game, when she would go up with
her knitting to Mrs. Leith’s sitting-room.</p>

<p>She had assisted also at another pastime
of Fleecy’s, which was more to the cat’s
fancy, but much less to that of its mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Mrs. Leith had a standing offer among
the servants for live mice, which it
afforded Fleecy the highest ecstasy to
catch. Always, when the poor little captives
would be brought (and fortunately
they seemed hard to secure, and were not
numerous), there would be a sharp conflict
in the mind of Mrs. Leith.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hate to see them frightened and
tortured so!” she would say; “but nothing
in the world gives Fleecy such delight,
and they don’t suffer long. Still, I wish
Fleecy liked the dead ones as well.”</p>

<p>She would take her darling in her arms,
and say: “Mouse, Fleecy, mouse!” and
there was no sort of doubt that the cat
understood. She would prick up her ears
and great plumy tail, and quiver with delighted
anticipation. Then, when the
trap was opened and the mouse let loose,
Mrs. Leith would clap her hands with
delight to see the joy and activity of her
great, indolent pet as she would scamper
about, over chairs and under tables, wildly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
pursuing her prey. Invariably, however,
when the final moment came, and the
piteous little dying squeaks would be
heard, Mrs. Leith would turn away and
shut her eyes tight, and put her fingers in
her ears. Sometimes, when Fleecy had
finished her meal, and sat licking her
lips, and drowsing in complacent repletion
by the fire, Mrs. Leith would give
way to reproaches of both her pet and
herself, and would think of the sufferings
of the poor little victim, till the tears came
into her eyes. In spite of that, however,
when another mouse was offered, the
same scene was invariably re-enacted.</p>

<p>She loved this cat with a passionate
affection; more, indeed, than that bestowed
by many mothers on their children. She
spent hours in combing and brushing its
long fur and tying on various ribbons,
and she often kissed and squeezed it so
ardently as to get scratched in return
for her tenderness. She called it by a
hundred tender names when this would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
happen, and blamed herself for her roughness.</p>

<p>There were certain little oddities in
Mrs. Leith’s behavior, now and then,
which Mrs. Bryan was quick to observe.
For instance, one day, when someone
remarked that Mr. Manning, the lawyer
who was conducting her divorce case, was
a very handsome man, Mrs. Leith smiled
to herself, in a confident, abstracted way
that piqued curiosity; and again, when
another man was commended for having
very delightful manners, Mrs. Leith said
with the same look on her face:</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think so, really?”</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Bryan, who was not very
imaginative, got the idea that the little
creature had some standard in her mind,
measured by which she found these men
very small.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leith spent almost her entire time
in her own room, sometimes singing to
herself, to a guitar accompaniment, impassioned
love songs that made her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
tremble from head to foot with emotion,
and often break into uncontrollable weeping.
When she was in her not infrequent
fits of despondency, even Fleecy was no
comfort to her, and she would sometimes
complain that she slept so contentedly on
the rug.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t love me. She only
wants to eat and sleep and be comfortable,”
she said one day, in an outburst of
despair. “Oh, nobody loves me, nobody
loves me! If God would only let me
die!”</p>

<p>“Mauma loves you, honey,” the old
woman answered. “God ain’ gwine tek
you ’way from po’ ole Mauma.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of your loving me,
when you don’t love Bertie? You hate
him, and you hate Fleecy, too—you know
you do! I don’t want anybody to love
me, if they don’t love them. Oh, I’m so
wretched!” and she went off into low wails
of anguish that subsided, as usual, in
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Many a time would old Mauma sit and
hold her so, until her arms and shoulders
ached. Small and childish as she was, she
was much heavier than a child, but she had
no more than a child’s consideration for the
trouble she gave, and Mauma would no
more have reproached her with this than
a mother her baby.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryan, out of sheer pity, began to
feel herself growing attached to her boarder.
She seemed to make, however, but
little progress in her acquaintance, and
things remained just as they had begun,
until there came a break in the monotony
of their intercourse, caused by the sudden
illness of Fleecy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leith flew wildly downstairs, one
morning, her face pallid with fear, and
dragged the astonished widow up the stairs,
exclaiming that Fleecy was dying. When
they got into the room, the big white cat
was lying on the lounge, stretching and
jerking its body, and giving every indication
of the vulgar malady of fits. Mauma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
was bending over the lounge, but her little
mistress flew at her and pulled her
away.</p>

<p>“You shan’t touch her,” she cried,
angrily, “go away! You have always
hated her, and you’ll be glad if she dies!
Oh, Mrs. Bryan, you will help me! Do
you think she is going to die? Oh,
Fleecy, Fleecy, my poor baby, don’t go
and leave me! You are all I’ve got in
the world.”</p>

<p>The old negress shrugged her shoulders
and moved away. It was evident that the
reproaches of her mistress amounted to
nothing with her. Mrs. Bryan, out of
pity for the poor child’s grief, went to
work to try to render aid, and, after a
little doctoring, Fleecy showed signs of
recovery. The gratitude showered upon
Mrs. Bryan was touching to see. Mrs.
Leith, usually so cold and abstracted in
her manner, became suddenly affectionate
and effusive. She kissed Mrs. Bryan’s
hands and then her face, and begged her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
not to leave her. When she was entirely
reassured about Fleecy, and had her darling
sleeping on her lap, she suddenly caught
hold of Mrs. Bryan’s hand and said, impulsively:</p>

<p>“You are good and kind. You have
a tender, loving heart. I’d like to talk to
you, and tell you about my troubles. May
I? Oh, if you knew how unhappy I am,
and how no one understands and sympathizes
with me!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryan moved closer to her, and
begged her to speak, assuring her, beforehand,
of the sympathy which showed
plainly in her face.</p>

<p>Then, still holding the big cat on her
lap, and touching it with tenderness from
time to time, Mrs. Leith told her story.</p>

<p>A singular one it was, and Mrs. Bryan,
as she listened, could not altogether wonder
at the friends who had refused to
sympathize with Mrs. Leith in her position.</p>

<p>The unhappy young wife, who was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Belton for the sole purpose of getting a
divorce from her husband, began her narration
by describing him in terms of
glowing enthusiasm, as the handsomest,
the cleverest, the most charming, gifted,
lovable being that mind could conceive.
“You think Mr. Manning is handsome,”
she said, “and you thought that other
man’s manners were charming! If you
could see Bertie! It makes me cross to
hear Mr. Manning and those other people
talked about. Why, Bertie is like what
you would imagine a great big angel to
be, if it hadn’t any wings and wore
clothes. He’s so tall and strong that he
can lift me about like a baby, and never
get tired in his shoulders, as Mauma does
after the least little while. He’s got a
figure more beautiful than any statue that
was ever made, and hair that curls in little
shiny rings the moment he lets it get long
enough. Oh, once, in Italy,” she broke
off, as a sudden memory came to her, “I
persuaded him to let it grow. We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the country, where no one knew us, and
it came down all about his neck. It was
so funny. We used to row a great deal,
and, though he wore a big peasant’s hat,
he got brown as a berry, but his neck was
always fair, where his hair hung over
it. I used to say it was the only place
left for me to kiss, because the sun had
made him brown as an Italian, so I
wouldn’t kiss him, except there. I
always said I felt as if I were kissing
some Italian woman’s husband. O Mrs.
Bryan,” she said, in a choking voice of
pain, “we were so happy then! He
loved me so! He never got tired of me,
and couldn’t bear me out of his sight. I
don’t see why I didn’t die then. If joy
could kill, I would have.” She paused a
second, and then went on, with a return
to her former tone: “You would have
to see him before you could understand how
poor all other men seem after him. His
voice is like a great strong lark’s, that can
sing and fly together. He used to sing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
until he could be heard for miles, all the
time that he was rowing me over those
tremendous waves that shook our little
boat about like a chip. I never dared to
go with any one else, but with him I never
had a fear. I often used to think we
would be drowned, but I would laugh at
the idea, and tell him it would be only to
wake up in another heaven with him.
Then you were talking about manners!
Oh, you can’t have any idea of Bertie’s
manners, and I couldn’t give you any!
He never goes into a crowded room that
everybody doesn’t look at him and speak
about him. He seems to know, at once,
the ways of every country, and never
makes a mistake. And gentle! why, he’s
gentler than any woman that ever lived!
Children always love him, and so do
animals. Fleecy loves him fifty times
better than she does me, and you ought to
see how he loves Fleecy. I thought it
was so good of him to let me keep my
dear kitty. I offered to give her up, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
he would not let me. I know she’d be
happier with Bertie, and I did offer, but
when he said no, I was glad, for Fleecy
was all I had left. If Bertie had been
here to-night, he would have nursed and
doctored her just as you did, instead of
getting cross like Mauma. Sometimes I
hate Mauma!” she broke off with a
vicious snap of her little regular teeth.</p>

<p>For a long time Mrs. Leith talked on,
dwelling on the attractions and perfections
of the man from whom she was seeking a
divorce, until finally her companion, unable
to keep down her curiosity any
longer, said abruptly:</p>

<p>“I can’t help asking, Mrs. Leith, why
you want to be divorced from such a man
as that.”</p>

<p>“Want to be!” she exclaimed, rising
to her feet, and forgetting even Fleecy,
who fell to the floor. “Want to be?
Why, I should think you could see that
it is killing me! Do I look like a person
doing what she wants to do? If you had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
seen me a year ago you would not say
that. Look at my poor thin arms,” pulling
up her sleeve. “They used to be so
plump and round that Bertie never tired
of kissing and praising them. And look
at my face, so white and pasty, when I
used to have a color like a rose! Oh,
I’m glad he can’t see me now! I’m
glad he doesn’t know how I have
changed!”</p>

<p>“Then why do you get the divorce?”
Mrs. Bryan couldn’t help saying. “You
are doing it, and not he—aren’t you?
What makes you do it?”</p>

<p>“Because he wants it,” she answered
with a look of defiance. She expected
nothing else but that Mrs. Bryan would
hold with all her other friends, and she
wanted to show her, at once, that she did
not care.</p>

<p>“And why does he want it?”</p>

<p>“Because he is tired of me—simply
that. No one but me can make allowances
for him, and I don’t expect it. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
know you are shocked and indignant and
all that, but you may save yourself the
trouble. It is terrible and unfortunate
for me, of course, but I can see, if no one
else does, that it is not unnatural. He
is highly cultivated and intellectual, and I
am not a companion for him. It was
long before I would acknowledge it, but I
have looked it in the face at last. I was
never worthy of him—but oh, while he
loved me, it didn’t matter in the least that
I was so inferior to him! And he did
love me—he did! he did!—as much as he
can love anybody—as much, I do believe,
as he will ever love that beautiful,
wicked woman he is going to marry.”</p>

<p>“Going to marry!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bryan, almost breathless, but the little
creature who stood near by with her cold
hands pressed against her burning cheeks,
and her excited eyes fixed on the fire, paid
no attention to the reflection of astonishment
in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, going to marry,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
“That is why he was so determined to
have the divorce. I knew he had begun
to weary of me; I knew I had nothing in
me to keep the love of a great creature
such as he is, but I think he would have
stayed with me and let me go on loving
him, at least, if he had not seen that
widow, who made up her mind to have
him the moment she laid eyes on him,
and saw how far above other men he
was.”</p>

<p>“But you could have prevented it!
He couldn’t have got the divorce from
you. Didn’t he know that?”</p>

<p>“Of course he knew it,” she answered,
in the petulant tone she often used to
Mauma. “He’s a man thoroughly informed
on every subject. He knew he
could never get it, and that the only way
was for me to do it. He made a great
mistake, though, and gave himself and me
six miserable months of suffering.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He tried to force me to sue for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
divorce,” she said; “and used every means
that he could think of. My friends were
wildly excited, and demanded that I should
get the divorce, but they might as well
have talked into the air. I had but one
answer: ‘I love him—love him—do
you understand? And there is nothing
love cannot forgive!’”</p>

<p>“Love—yes,” retorted Mrs. Bryan,
now no longer able to control her indignation.
“Love is all very well—but where
is your pride?”</p>

<p>The tiny creature standing on the rug
drew herself to her full height, and looked
her in the eyes, as she answered:</p>

<p>“I have none, where he is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Merciful goodness!” exclaimed the
other, with a deep-drawn breath. “Then
if you haven’t any pride, what induced
you to agree to the divorce?”</p>

<p>“Love,” said the other, solemnly. “If
he had understood that—if he had made
that appeal at first—he might have had
his way in the beginning, instead of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
end. If, instead of subjecting me to all
the shame and outrage that he made me
endure, he had done at first what he did at
last, he might have spared himself as well
as me much suffering.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you consented
because——”</p>

<p>“Because I loved him,” she replied, in
a voice beginning to shake, as her eyes
began to fill. “Oh, why do I talk about
it? No one will ever understand. You
are all alike, and blame me, because you
don’t know what it is to love, as I love
him. He came to me at last, after those
awful months, and when he came into the
room and shut the door behind him, and I
looked up and feasted my hungry eyes on
the sight of him, the love that shook my
breast then was a thing you other women
don’t know. He called my name.
‘Mimi,’ he said, ‘you have it in your
power to make me happy, if you will.’
And I said: ‘I will do anything you ask.’
He came then and took me in his arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and told me he wanted me to get the
divorce. He said he was selfish and vile
and unworthy of me, that I would be
happier without him, and a great deal more
such trash, and I told him I had but one
desire in the world, and that was to make
him happy, and that I would give him the
divorce. With those arms around me,
and those eyes looking into mine beseechingly,
there was nothing I could have
denied him—only I had rather it had
been the last drop of my blood he had
asked for. That was not what he wanted,
though, and I gave him what he did want.
I asked him if it would not please him
better if I were dead, and if he had said
yes, I would have killed myself. But he
said no, that would make him wretched;
he only wanted me to let him be free, and
to be free myself to marry some good man
who would make me happy as I deserved.
He knows that woman isn’t good; he
told me so himself—at least he said she
was utterly different from me, and so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
more fit to be the companion of a poor
devil like himself. I don’t know how it
is,” she broke off, passionately, “but if
being a devil could make him love me
again, I’d be a devil, too, if I could! Of
course you’re shocked, but I would!
Well, no matter what happens, I’ve got
that evening to remember. He had not
been pleased with me for so long, that it
was like heaven on earth to have him as
he was then. He let me sit on his lap,
and hold him tight around the neck, and
kiss his curls and his eyes and his darling
mouth. You needn’t look so horrified,”
she said with sudden resentment, “he
was my husband still, and he’s my husband
now, and I’m proud and happy I can say
it a little while longer.”</p>

<p>At the last words her voice gave way
completely, and she threw herself down on
the lounge and burst into violent sobbing.
It was piteous to see her, and Mrs. Bryan,
in spite of the tempestuous indignation
this recital had aroused in her, felt her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
heart grow soft with sympathy as she
looked at the little figure, no bigger than
that of many a child of fourteen, shaken
with great sobs of anguish—the deep and
incurable anguish of a loving and despised
wife.</p>

<p>She did her best to comfort her, and
forced herself not to criticise, knowing
intuitively what the poor little thing must
have already suffered at the hands of her
friends.</p>

<p>She found, however, that the task of
comforting her was an impossible one.
All she could do was to soothe and speak
lovingly to her, and to avoid abuse of her
husband; she felt it would be the cause of
hopeless estrangement between them, if
she allowed herself to express her true
opinion of him.</p>

<p>At last, when Mrs. Leith had consented
to be covered up, and made physically
comfortable, and had drunk a cup of tea,
Mrs. Bryan left her to try to get a nap.
She had Fleecy in her arms, with her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
peeping out above the coverlet, and had
laid her cheek against it with a degree of
affectionateness that she seemed unable to
show to the human beings about her.</p>

<p>“It is only because Bertie loves Fleecy,
and she loves him,” said the little creature,
answering the unspoken thought which
she had read in Mrs. Bryan’s eyes.</p>

<p>As the latter passed through the outer
room, where Mauma was sitting at the
window running the narrow ribbons in
and out of the eyelet holes in Mrs. Leith’s
dainty French underclothes, she stopped
and looked at the old woman inquiringly.</p>

<p>“She bin tell you all ’bout it, has she?”
said Mauma, looking up over the top of
her brass-rimmed spectacles. “I knowed
how it gwine be, soon ez I see you done
tech her heart, by nussing o’ that black
varmint.” (It always seemed to give
Mauma great satisfaction to apply the word
“black” to Fleecy’s creamy whiteness.)
“I’m glad you kin mek out to show some
likin’ fur de dirty thing, en to please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Missy I’d do it myself, ef I could. De
Lord knows ef anythin’ kin please her, I
want her to have it, but it’s more’n I got
sense to do, to ack like I love dem two
darlin’s o’ hern.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t like Mr. Leith,
either?” said Mrs. Bryan, tentatively.</p>

<p>“Like him? Nor’m, I don’t like him,
I don’ like him for nuthin’—a good-for
nuthin’, low-life raskill, as ain’t worthy
to tech Missy’s feet! Thar ain’ but one
thing in the worl’ I won’ do for Missy, en
that’s it! I ain’ gwine say I like him, kus
I pintedly don’t, en I’d wring he neck
same ez a chicken’s, ef I had de chance.
Lor’, mistiss, you don’ know. You don’
know nuthin’! De sights he is tuk dat air
little angel-chile through is enough to tun
yer hyar right white. ’Tain’ no kine o’
shame en meanness he ain’ bin heap up on
her—a puppus to mek her git de divoce.
En you think she’d do it? Nor’m, she
wouldn’! She bin quoil wid ev’ry fr’en’
she got in de worl’ ’long o’ that! She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
ain’ ’low nobody to say nuthin’ gin’ him.
All she say is, ‘When you love, you kin
furgive anything.’ He mought ’a’ kep’ on,
twel jedgmen’-day, en he mought ’a’ drug
her through de streets by de hyar o’ her
hade, en she wouldn’ nuver ’a’ uttered
a complaint. De warn’ but one way
he could ’a’ got her to git dat divoce,
en he jis dat mean en sneakin’ dat he bin
foun’ dat way out. He come to her at las’
wid all he impident, sweet ways, en he jiss
coax en beg for it. I knowed den ’twas
all up. She ain’ nuver been able to say
no to him in her life, en she couldn’t say
it den. So she tell him. Yes, she do it
fur de sake o’ makin’ him happy en pleased
wid her. She sont right off fur de lawyer,
en made all de ’rangements. I hear him
tell her myself dat ’twas easy ’nough to do.
Yes, Lord! I reckon ’twas easy, wid
dem scan’lous doin’s o’ his! Lor’, honey,
you don’ know,” and the old woman
ended, shaking her head with an air of
deep mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>The ice once broken between Mrs.
Bryan and her boarder, frequent confidences
followed, but it was always the
same thing, with more or less detail, as to
the charm, superiority and lovableness of
the husband she had renounced, or was
now making it her business in life to
renounce. It was evident to Mrs. Bryan
that the days passed all too quickly for
Mr. Manning’s client, and that she clung
desperately to the mere form that retained
him as her husband.</p>

<p>In the monotonous regularity of her
life at Belton she began to improve in
health and looks. Mauma attributed it
to the fact that she no longer had the
torment of discussions and protest from
her relatives and friends, who had one
and all abandoned her to her own devices.
So indomitable a will in so slight
a body, it was certainly strange to find.
After the promise to her husband she had
never faltered, though the idea of the
divorce was evidently terrible to her beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
words. She told Mrs. Bryan that
she was twenty years of age, but it was
hard to believe it. She looked a mere slip
of a girl, and was made with such exquisite
perfection, that that fact seemed to make
her look smaller than she really was.
Every one who saw her was fascinated by
her beauty, but she was cold to all overtures
of friendship, and seemed to have
exhausted on her husband and Fleecy all
her capacity for affection. She still cared
scrupulously for her toilet, though she
wore only the one or two dark dresses
in which she had appeared on first coming
to Belton. Her mother had been a Creole,
and from this source she had got her little
French name, Mimi, which she told Mrs.
Bryan her husband usually abbreviated
into “Mim.” There was also a trace of
her French origin in her utterance—a
certain peculiarity of the <i>r</i>—that gave
her a sort of unusualness which added to
her charm.</p>

<p>One day, the morning of which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
passed in the usual uneventful way, Mrs.
Leith was sitting with Mrs. Bryan in the
latter’s sitting-room, when a telegram was
brought in. Mrs. Bryan took it, and then
handed it to her companion, to whom it
was addressed. As she read it she sprang
to her feet and uttered a cry—unmistakably
a cry of joy.</p>

<p>“Read it—he is coming!” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryan put on her glasses and read
these words:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">“Must see you on important business. Arrive
at eight o’clock.</p>

<p class="right">“B.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>“I must go—I must get ready. Where
is Mauma? Mauma!” she called as she
hurried from the room, and ran up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mrs. Bryan went to
her boarder’s room. She found everything
in confusion. Trunks stood open in the
middle of the floor; Eastern stuffs were
scattered all about; exquisite dresses were
lying in heaps, and poor old Mauma, with
protest written on the very curve of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
back, was diving into a trunk, and tranquilly
accepting a scolding for not knowing
where some indispensable article was.</p>

<p>“I am going to hang these stuffs about
the room, and get out a few ornaments,”
Mrs. Leith explained. “I won’t hurt anything,
but Bertie does so love to see things
look ‘homey and comfy,’ as he calls it.
Will you send someone to the florist, and
tell him I want lots of flowers—all that he
has? Oh, Mrs. Bryan, do tell me—honestly
and candidly—which of these dresses
I look best in. You see, I can’t tell just
what humor he will be in. Sometimes he
likes to see me dressed as richly as possible—and
then again I can’t be too simple.
Oh, yes, I forgot—I know what I’ll
wear! I’d rather he’d see me very simple—for
I can imagine he’s seen plenty of
magnificence lately. I’ll wear just this little
white <i>crêpe</i> gown—one he used to love.
Perhaps he’ll remember he praised it once,
and be pleased at my remembering. Oh,
Mauma, where’s the girdle? You don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
seem to know where anything is, and if
you’ve lost that girdle—” she stopped,
with sudden tears of vexation in her eyes.</p>

<p>Mauma came toward her with the girdle
in her hand. She darted forward to take it,
and gave the old woman a sudden hug, as
she said, coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross with me to-day,
Mauma—please don’t. I’m so happy.
You ought to be glad your child is going
to be happy once more in her life. He’s
sure to be pleased with me, for I’ve done
every little thing he wants. Oh, to think
I’m going to see him once more!”
Then, with a sudden change of tone, she
added: “Don’t be vexed with me if I’m
cross and rude to-day. I’m so wild with
joy that I can’t stand the suggestion of
anything else. And oh, Mrs. Bryan, if
you saw him, you would not wonder.
Promise me this,” she cried, seizing the
other woman by both hands with intense
earnestness, “promise me that you will go
to the door, yourself, when he comes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that you’ll just say some little thing to
him, so as to make him speak. I want
you to hear his voice, and get some idea
of his manner. Then, after that, if you
talk about Mr. Manning or Mr. Anybody
else, I’ll promise to listen to you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryan agreed to do as she wished,
and went away more puzzled and astonished
at the ways of her boarder than she
had been yet.</p>

<p>Shortly before eight o’clock that evening,
Mrs. Bryan, dressed in her neatest
black dress, and wearing her freshest cap,
went up to Mrs. Leith’s sitting-room.
When she entered, she hardly recognized
it, and felt as if she must be in a dream.
Wax candles, with pink shades, were set
about in groups; the walls and furniture
were decorated with rich embroideries and
Eastern stuffs, and beautiful flowers were
massed together on tables and mantel.
Fleecy had been freshly washed, and was
ornamented with a gay pink ribbon tied in
an enormous bow at the back of her neck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
suspending a little gold bell, which tinkled
as she walked about with her great tail in
the air. A glowing wood fire burned on
the hearth, and on a white fur rug, which
had been spread in front of it, stood Mimi.
The metamorphosis in her was quite as
startling as in the room. She was dressed
in a scant and clinging little gown of white
<i>crêpe</i>, half-low about the throat, from
which a fall of creamy lace hung down.
It was loosely gathered in about the waist
by a silver girdle, and had great flowing
sleeves, from which her little hands came
out divested of all ornament, except her
wedding-ring. Her tiny feet were cased
in white slippers worked with silver. But
the wonder of it all was her face. It was
nothing short of radiantly beautiful this
evening. Her eyes sparkled and her cheeks
were pink as roses. Her hair, instead of
being twisted, as usual, into a decorous
knot, was falling free about her shoulders.
It was not long, but curly and fluffy as a
child’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“You look about twelve years old,”
was Mrs. Bryan’s comment.</p>

<p>“Bertie always said so, when I wore my
hair like this,” she answered, delightedly.
“He loves it this way best of all. I was
so afraid I’d look too old to do it; but if
I have grown old and thin, thank the <i>good</i>
God, it doesn’t show to-night!”</p>

<p>It was the first expression of religious
fervor that Mrs. Bryan had ever heard her
use; but as she said this, she clasped her
hands and looked upward in a rapture of
thanksgiving, the sincerity of which could
not be doubted.</p>

<p>“Fleecy, do you know who’s coming?”
she exclaimed, suddenly catching
the big cat up, and looking into its face as
if it had been a child’s. “Master, Fleecy—master!”</p>

<p>Fleecy certainly pricked up her ears,
seeing which her mistress covered her with
rapturous kisses, while Mrs. Bryan had
more than a suspicion that Fleecy mistook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the word “master” for “mouse;” but
this she would not have dared to suggest.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it after eight?” said Mimi, looking
at the little clock on the mantel. “Oh,
if he shouldn’t come!” And at the
thought of this the color faded from her
cheeks. It came bounding back, however,
the next minute, as the door-bell was
heard.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bryan reached the landing
at the head of the stairs, she found Mauma
leaning over the railing and looking into
the hall below.</p>

<p>“Is it Mr. Leith?” Mrs. Bryan asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s him—the ugly buzzard!”
answered Mauma, with intense disgust.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to smile at this
comment as applied to the man whom Mrs.
Bryan now went forward to meet. She
acknowledged at once, as she saw him
shaking the thick snowflakes from the
collar of his coat, that his beauty had not
been exaggerated. He was a magnificent,
blond creature, with youthful strength and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
health in every line of figure and face. A
ready smile of good humor rose to his lips,
as he took off his hat with a splendid grace
and made Mrs. Bryan a bow.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Leith is expecting you,” she
said. “Will you go up to her sitting-room?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, when I have got rid
of some of this snow. I must ask your
forgiveness for bringing so much of it into
your house. It’s clean, however, and I
hope will do no harm.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he was taking off his long,
fur-lined coat, and as he threw in on a
chair, he looked at her again and smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll have it brushed for you!”
she said, and then stopped short, provoked
at having been so civil to the man whom
she had intended to treat with cold contempt.</p>

<p>“Walk upstairs,” she said, more distantly.
“I’ll go with you, and show you
the room.”</p>

<p>He gave her the smallest of bows, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
it gave the old widow an agreeable sense
of homage. As he preceded her up the
stairs, he said, in a voice no one could
fail to find delightful:</p>

<p>“What a fascinating old house you
have!”</p>

<p>The compliment was agreeable to her,
but at the same time she felt a certain indignation
that he could be so unmoved at
the prospect of an interview which had
put that poor child, waiting yonder, in a
fever of agitation.</p>

<p>Mauma had disappeared from the landing,
and when Mrs. Bryan had pointed out
the door, she turned and went downstairs.
She heard his quick knock, and then the
turn of the knob. As she looked back, he
was just disappearing and closing the door
after him.</p>

<p>In the room beyond that closed door intense
silence reigned for some moments.
Leith had come no farther than across the
threshold, and stood with his back against
the door. Then, undoubtedly, Fleecy recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
him, for she came forward and
began to rub against his legs, making a
purring noise distinctly audible in the silent
room. Fleecy’s mistress stood on the rug
intensely still, with her hands clasped tight
together.</p>

<p>Presently the man spoke, in his very
gentlest voice.</p>

<p>“Fleecy is glad to see me,” he said in
a tone of tender reproach.</p>

<p>“And so am I! Oh, Bertie!” she
gasped, catching her breath with a sort of
sob.</p>

<p>“Are you?” he said, and, standing where
he was, he held out his arms. In a second
she had flown to them, and the great man
had lifted her off her feet and caught her
to his breast and held her there. She
clung with both arms around his neck, and
laid her face in the hollow of his throat.
For a few seconds neither spoke, and then
he put her down, still holding one of her
hands, and led her so across the room.</p>

<p>“So you are glad to see me, Mim!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
he said, standing on the hearth-rug, and
taking her little face between his large,
beautiful hands.</p>

<p>“I worship you,” she said, looking up
at him, through two big tears.</p>

<p>“So you’re just as big a goose as
ever!” he said, almost in a whisper, still
holding her so and looking down at her.
“I suppose I ought to be sorry, but do you
think I am? Well, I’m not. I’m glad!”
Impossible to describe the winning charm
of this man’s manner, or the tender beauty
of his face as he said this. “But stand
off and let me look at you,” he went
on, loosing her face to take her two hands
and hold her at arm’s length by them.
“Who said you were losing your beauty?
It’s not so. You’re absolutely bewitching.
I doubt—now I’m going to tell you
something that will make you happy for a
year—I seriously doubt, upon my word of
honor, whether any one else in the world
is so pretty.”</p>

<p>She smiled until her cheeks dimpled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
but the next moment the tears had sprung
to her eyes.</p>

<p>“What does it matter,” she said, “if
you don’t care?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I, though? I can tell you I do
care tremendously. Do you suppose, after
all that’s been between you and me, that I
shall lose interest in you and never care
what happens to you in the future?”</p>

<p>“But if we never see each other——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he said hurriedly.
“That’s pretty hard, poor baby! But
don’t think, in spite of all that’s happened,
don’t think I’m not sorry for you. Sometimes,
when I think about how unhappy
and lonely you are, it drives me wild. I
have to go to the theatre, or play polo, or
do something to make me forget it.
There’s one thought that always consoles
me, however, and that is that you’ll be well
rid of such a scamp as I am. I’ve been
a brute to you, Mimi, and one thing that
brought me here was to ask you to forgive
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“There’s nothing to forgive, Bertie;
I’ve never had one hard feeling toward
you,” she answered in a low and resolutely
steadied voice.</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re an angel on
earth, not because I haven’t treated you
abominably. I know it and confess it
freely, but I hate to think about it.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t think about it, our last
evening together.”</p>

<p>The words almost choked her, and he
saw her throat swell; he saw, too, that she
was making a tremendous effort not to
cry. They had sat down in two chairs in
front of the fire, and were looking away
from each other. After a short silence the
man turned toward her, compelling her, by
his persistent gaze, to turn her eyes to his.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“It isn’t natural for us to sit together
like this. You used to—” He smiled
and laid his hand on his knee. She came
at once and took the seat, and when she
had done so, he lifted one of her arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and laid it around his neck. Then he
laughed—a low laugh of appreciative
amusement.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know whether this
is proper or not,” he said, “and I suppose
you can’t inform me. By Jove, this <i>is</i> a
situation! Come, Mim, I always said you
had no sense of humor, but you can’t
help seeing the fun of this!”</p>

<p>The poor child tried her best to smile,
but perhaps his accusation of her was not
unjust, for the effect was a complete failure,
and she had to hide her face against his
neck to conceal the fact that tears had
come instead of smiles.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to make me laugh,” she
said; “if you do, I’m sure to cry, and I
do not want to do that. It always made
you angry to see me cry.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, we won’t laugh or cry
either. We’ll just be sensible, and you’ll
show me what a little brick you really are.
You’ve acted in a way already to win a
tremendous respect from me. You can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
just remember that. I don’t know another
woman who’d have behaved as well. And,
now, let me show you something. Don’t
move, it’s just here in my pocket. I had
such a sweet idea the other day. You
see,” he went on, as she sat up to look,
“I knew you’d feel badly about leaving
off the ring, when—when the time comes,
so I’ve got you another—not plain gold,
of course, but one you can always wear,
in place of it, for my sake. Isn’t it a little
beauty?” He opened his hand and showed
her a ring set with two very perfect pearls,
one white and one black.</p>

<p>“The white’s for you, and the black’s
for me,” he said, laughing, as he slipped it
on her finger. “I knew it would fit,” he
went on, “for <i>I</i> knew what a mite of a
hand it was for! The man thought it was
for a child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dear, how lovely, how beautiful
it is!” said Mimi. “How good you
were to think of it! But, Bertie—” She
hesitated a moment, and then said: “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
won’t be vexed if I ask you something,
will you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, with a slight
frown. “I don’t like questions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that—and I’m not going
to inquire into anything! You needn’t
be afraid of that. All I want is to know
whether—when the time comes—I’ll be
obliged to take off my wedding-ring?
Couldn’t I wear it still?”</p>

<p>She looked into his face with the most
earnest beseeching, and evidently with intense
anxiety as to his reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you could—if you
wanted to! I don’t see why not. I
never heard of anyone’s doing it, but of
course you can keep it on, if it will be a
comfort to you. It’s a natural enough
wish. Precious thing! I declare it’s
perfectly touching!”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Bertie, <i>thank</i> you!”
she cried, throwing her arms around his
neck again. “You don’t know what a
load you have taken off my mind!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Poor little Mim,” he said, gently
stroking her hair, “how you can care as
you do about such a devil of a scamp as I
am is the mystery!”</p>

<p>“You are not—you are good,” she
said brokenly, “and Bertie, there is just
one more thing I want to ask you to let me
keep. If you’ll do that, I’ll be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>She put her lips to his ear and whispered:
“Your name.”</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately, and
turning to look in his face, she saw that
he looked perplexed.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, my darling child, I
don’t know how that is, but if it can be
arranged, of course I am willing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bertie, Bertie! How can I
ever thank you? I was almost afraid to
ask it—but it would break my heart to
have to give up your name.”</p>

<p>“There, then, precious child, you
shan’t!” he said, soothingly. “I’ll talk
to the lawyers about it at once. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
are one or two business points on which
I have to speak to you—things you will
have to give your consent to. That is
what I came chiefly to see about—at least
that was my excuse, though I wanted to
see you, too, and to be sure you had forgiven
me. You do believe I’m sorry for
all the pain I’ve caused you—don’t you,
darling?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you are! I know you
wouldn’t have done it willingly. It was
only a misunderstanding. If you had
come to me at first and told me what
you wanted me to do, I would have done
it. It’s the same thing now. There is
no need to consult me. All you have to
do is to tell me what it is you want me to
consent to.”</p>

<p>“We can get through with it very
quickly, then,” he said. “I might have
known how good and generous you would
be; but you see I can’t help making the
mistake of thinking you are like the rest
of the world, which you are not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>He explained to her briefly, then, the
points on which he had wanted to confer
with her, but found, as she had said, that
he had her consent to everything he wished
beforehand.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let’s spoil our last, last
time, by talking about things like that!”
she said, presently. “Let’s take Fleecy
up between us and be happy this once, as
we used to be all the time.”</p>

<p>So Fleecy was called and put in the old
familiar place, where she nestled snugly
down, and purred and dozed in absolute
contentment. Both of them caressed the
cat in silence for a moment, the tiny hand
following the big one up and down its
back. Presently Mimi lifted her hand, and
said:</p>

<p>“Kiss my ring, please. I should always
be regretting it, if I didn’t make you do
that.” He kissed it, and the hand too,
holding it against his lips a full moment,
so that she felt his breath upon it.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke again: “Have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
been good?” she said. “Are you pleased
with me, Bertie? Do tell me so, if you
are. I want to remember that you said
so.”</p>

<p>“Pleased with you, my good little darling?
Why, how could I fail to be? The
more I see of your goodness, the more
convinced I am that I was never worthy
of you, and my hope is that, once freed
of me, you will meet some man who
will deserve you better and make you
happy.”</p>

<p>She put her little hand over his mouth,
so that the last words were stifled, as she
said to him, in a voice of keen reproach:</p>

<p>“Bertie, how can you, how dare you
think of such a thing? It is the one
thing on earth I couldn’t forgive you for.
I can forgive utterly and freely your getting
tired of me, and wanting a cleverer,
handsomer, more amusing wife. It is nothing
but natural that you should, and I can
see it. But, oh, my dear darling, don’t
believe that I could ever love any one else!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
If I thought you would believe that of me,
I don’t believe I could help killing myself.
Promise me, Bertie; give me your word,
you’ll never say such a thing as that
again.”</p>

<p>“I promise, child; I promise,” he replied,
half-awed by the intensity of her
reproach. “You are a mystery to me,
and I’m a mystery to myself, to have
won such love.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t win it,” she said; “you
just got it, by being what you are.”</p>

<p>“But no one else has ever given it to
me—or ever will,” he added, with conviction.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said, with a deep, indrawn
breath, sitting upright on his knee, and
clasping her hands tight together, “you
will find that out, Bertie! I know no
one will ever love you as I do.”</p>

<p>“I know it too,” he said, a look of
despondency suddenly crossing his face.</p>

<p>“Bertie,” she said, timidly. “Don’t
be angry with me if I ask you something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“I warned you not to ask questions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but I’m not going to do
anything to bother you. I promise that,
and you know I always keep my word.
Only, if you would tell me about things,
it would be easier than hearing it from
others, or from the papers. But suppose,”
she was watching his face intently, to see
if its expression permitted her to go on,
“suppose,” she said, timidly, “you were
to grow tired of her, and wanted her, for
your sake, to give you your freedom. Do
you think she’d love you enough to do
what I have done?”</p>

<p>A curious smile came suddenly to his
face:</p>

<p>“Do what you have done?” he said.
“I think she’d probe for my heart with a
polished stiletto sooner, or put a spider into
my dumpling!”</p>

<p>“Then she loves herself better than
she loves you—and I love you better
than I love myself!”</p>

<p>She said these words with an infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
satisfaction, and the expression of her face
was triumphant—almost happy. Her
cheeks had still that feverish color, and
her eyes were wide and brilliant, as they
rested with a hungry, expectant look upon
his face. He, meantime, sat silent, looking
into the fire. When, at last, compelled
by her steady gaze, he looked at
her, there was such dumb, intense entreaty
in her eyes as he could not misunderstand.</p>

<p>“Mim,” he said, in a whisper, “do you
want me to kiss you?”</p>

<p>The tears sprang to her eyes. “If you
wouldn’t mind—just once,” she answered.</p>

<p>Their lips met in a long kiss. As he
drew backward from it, he put her gently
from him, and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I must say good-by, now,” he said.
“It’s time for me to go.”</p>

<p>She gave a little cry, and looked at him
with a half-distracted gaze, as she said,
excitedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Oh, not yet—not yet, surely! I
thought you would stay for hours. Oh,
Bertie, don’t leave me yet—just as we
were so happy! My heart will break!”</p>

<p>She turned away with an instinct to
conceal from him the agony in her face.
He saw her wring her little hands together,
and then put them to her lips and bite
them, and he knew she was making an
effort, for his sake, not to cry. But it was
worse still to see this courageous struggle
with agony, and his one thought was to
get away.</p>

<p>“Bertie,” she said, suddenly turning
toward him her pallid and terrified face,
“I’m going to bear it if I can. I’ll do
my very best, but if—if I find I can’t—if
it is going to be like this always, and I
can’t bear it, would you mind it very
much—do you think you could keep from
letting it make you unhappy—if I couldn’t
bear it—and killed myself?”</p>

<p>“Mind it! What are you talking about!
Why, what do you think I’m made of?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
I should never have another happy moment
as long as I lived. You would simply
make me a miserable man for life.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t do it!” she said, hurriedly.
“Indeed, indeed, I won’t! Don’t
look at me reproachfully, darling! Forget
that I ever thought of that. It was only
a moment’s frenzy, and it doesn’t really
amount to anything. I give you my
promise not to do it, and I know you’ll
believe in that.”</p>

<p>“Lord, what a relief!” he said, with a
great sigh. “You frightened me out of
my wits; but of course you didn’t mean
it. Now that you’ve promised, I feel safe.
You are too good and tender to give me
such a life-long sorrow as that would be.
You never could have done it; but it gave
me a scare. You don’t believe it now,
but once it is inevitable, you’ll get over
this extreme feeling about me, and be
happy.”</p>

<p>“O Bertie,” she said, timidly, “I don’t
want to make you angry, dearest, but if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
you only <i>wouldn’t</i> say that! I’m willing
for you to think of me as happy, if it
would comfort you, but not by losing one
atom of my love for you. Try to think
of it this way—that I’m happy because
I love you, so that to have given you the
wish of your heart makes me happier than
to have the wish of my heart. Will you
try?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will, darling. I’ll do
anything on earth I can to please you.
I’m sure I ought. But now,” glancing
at the clock, “I must really be going. I’m
obliged to get back on to-night’s train.”</p>

<p>It was no use struggling any longer. She
had no strength for the effort. With
the weakness of utter surrender, she threw
herself into his arms and sobbed.</p>

<p>“There, there, baby,” he said, soothingly.
“Don’t cry so, darling. Why,
there’s lots and lots to make you happy in
life yet. I’ll always remember you as
the noblest and most unselfish little woman
that ever lived; you’ll have that to comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
you. Don’t let it make you so wretched,
precious child. You and Fleecy will have
many merry days together yet.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Fleecy, who was
contentedly napping on the rug, the poor
little creature lifted her head, to say,
brokenly:</p>

<p>“Would you like to have Fleecy? You
always loved her so. I meant to tell you
you could have her if you wanted. I
could give her up, if it would please you.”</p>

<p>“No, my precious, no—not for the
world. I wouldn’t take her from you, for
anything. How could you think I’d be
so selfish?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling,” she sobbed,
with her face hidden on his shoulder. “I
wouldn’t care so very much to keep her,
but that you gave her to me, and loved
her, and she was always with us when we
were so happy. Oh, Bertie, darling, beloved,
precious treasure of my heart,
you’ve been so good to me! You made
me, for two years, the happiest creature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
outside of heaven. If it’s any comfort
to you, you can think of that.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will be a comfort to
me, darling—and, by Jove, I expect to
need something to comfort me, when I
think of you, and how unhappy I’ve made
you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t reproach yourself. You
couldn’t help it. I always knew there
was nothing in me to keep the love of
such a man as you. Oh, Bertie, my husband!”
she cried, still clasping his neck,
but drawing back that she might look into
his eyes, “let me call you by that name
once more, for you are still my husband—mine,
mine, mine, and no one else’s!
Call me ‘wife’ once more, my darling,
before we say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“My little wife, my little wife—my
good, true, noble, unselfish, little wife,” he
said, while her arms clasped him tighter
and tighter, and a shiver shook her little
frame from head to foot.</p>

<p>The man’s face, too, was seamed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the lines of pain and disturbance. He
looked at the clock and at the door, with
the evident desire to escape; but he could
not force her from him while she cried
and clung like this.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said,
suddenly, as a thought struck him, “I’ll
walk you, as I used to do, when you got
nervous and unhappy. It always made
you quiet—do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re so good to me, darling!”
she murmured, as he took her up in his
arms like a child, and began to walk up
and down the room with her. He was
magnificently strong, and she was light
and little, so that it was no great tax upon
him. Fleecy, with her plumy tail held
high and her little gold bell tinkling, joined
them, and walked at their side, up and
down, up and down. Now and then
Mimi would murmur some words of
tenderness and gratitude, and he would
answer with some soothing caress.</p>

<p>The faculty of humor was not lacking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
in his composition, at least, for, in spite of
the agitated pain he had just been suffering,
when he caught sight of the little procession
in passing a mirror, he smiled at his
own reflection. The smile was quickly
suppressed, however, as he went on speaking
to her soothingly. It had—as he
had predicted—a marvellous effect. The
little thing ceased sobbing, and her breast
grew quiet, after its excited heavings.</p>

<p>At last, the clock struck, and he took
her to the lounge and laid her down. “I
have not another moment,” he said, “you
will let me go now, like the good, brave
darling you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered, in a faint, unnatural
tone. “I’ll let you go now. Tell
me good-by once more.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, my darling wife.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, my darling husband.”</p>

<p>She put her lips up, and he pressed a
quick kiss on them, and was gone.</p>

<p>On the landing outside Mauma was sitting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
erect and repellent, in every line of
figure and face.</p>

<p>“Go to your mistress, Mauma,” said
Leith. “I trust you to look after her
and take good care of her.”</p>

<p>“Yes—bress de Lord, I say!” replied
Mauma, with cold contempt. “It’s a
pow’ful good thing nobody don’ trus’ <i>you</i>—fur
that or nuthin’! Dee’d find
deeselves mistaken, ef dee did.”</p>

<p>With a smile of amusement, the man
shook off the sadness that had clung to
him, in coming from that room, and said
in a gay, though carefully lowered tone:</p>

<p>“You’re just the same as ever, Mauma,
I see! Well, I’m glad of it. I wouldn’t
have you changed for anything. I always
told your mistress that you were the one
woman I had found it impossible to win!
So, you see, you have a unique charm for
me.”</p>

<p>“I hope to de Lord some woman’ll
pay you back fur what you’se bin mek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
dat angil-child suffer,” was the solemn
response, “en you mark my words—de
day’s gwine come!”</p>

<p>With his unfailing instinct to escape
from what was unpleasant, Leith hurried
down the stairs, threw on his coat, and let
himself out into the street. As the door
closed behind him, Mauma, bending over
her little mistress, found that she was in a
dead faint.</p>

<p>Restoratives were used, and she at last
recovered consciousness; but that evening’s
ordeal was followed by a long attack of
fever, in which death, after promising
relief for a while, withdrew and left her
to her life of misery.</p>

<p>“There is one blessing in this illness,”
Mr. Manning said to Mrs. Bryan, when
he called one day to inquire for the invalid,
“she never knew the day of her divorce.
Now she will just recognize the fact that
it is past, and that she’s no longer that
scoundrel’s wife. A more cold-blooded,
selfish, unmitigated brute I never came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
across, and it’s a blessed thing she’s got
the divorce, poor little thing! All the
same, it has broken her heart.”</p>

<p>By the time the invalid was able to go
about again, the papers mentioned the
marriage of Herbert Leith, in Spain.</p>

<p>Nothing but the bare fact reached the
ears of Mimi, who still bears his name
and wears his ring, and bullies Mauma and
pampers Fleecy, and looks almost as childish,
though never as pretty again, as she
did on the night of that parting.</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary!”</p>

<p>These words were uttered aloud by Mr.
Black as he sat alone in his editorial office,
engaged in the laborious work of reading
manuscript. He was a reserved man; indeed,
he had to be, for nothing but his great
self-possession and power of concentration
could have enabled him to get through
with the duties of his position. With the
aid of these, however, he did accomplish
them thoroughly and systematically, and
was always deliberate in his manner—rarely
hurried, and rarely excited.</p>

<p>For this reason it was all the more remarkable
that such an exclamation as the
one recorded should have escaped him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
His duties included such an endless amount
of boredom that the perusal of a manuscript
which could have had such words
applied to it would have been cause for
immense gratulation to him, had it been
its merit which had called forth such an
expression. As a matter of fact, it was
not this, but rather a very extraordinary
coincidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Black was possessed of a marvellous
insight into the literary demands of
his subscribers, and it was this insight
which had swelled his list to its present size;
and he knew perfectly well that the manuscript
now in his hands would have to be
refused, as he knew also that the one which
he had laid down just before it must share
the same fate. And yet to himself, personally,
both of these manuscripts had been
of deep and peculiar interest.</p>

<p>The first was written in a woman’s
hand, and was signed “Ethel Ross,” and,
in the note that had accompanied it, Miss
Ethel Ross had given her address in a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
small and obscure town. This note,
as well as the manuscript itself, had a certain
<i>naïveté</i> about it which gave Mr. Black
some insight into the writer. The freedom
with which the note was written was
of a piece with the freedom with which
the manuscript was written, and Mr. Black
felt pretty sure that both of them were
under the protection of a <i>nom de guerre</i>.
The young lady calling herself Miss
Ethel Ross had taken him into her confidence
in the amusing way in which a contributor
so often confides in an unknown
editor. Mr. Black, however, was a very
human-hearted editor, and he never objected
to these confidences, and even did
what he could to give a friendly word of
response to the writers, independent of his
judgment of the manuscript.</p>

<p>In this instance the writer had acknowledged
the fact that this was her first manuscript,
and had added that it would probably
be her last! She had always heard,
she went on to say, that everybody had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
one story in them, and, if that saying were
true, this was her story. She had never
thought of writing for publication before,
she said, but for certain reasons she had
suddenly concluded to make the effort,
and the accompanying manuscript was the
result.</p>

<p>With these data to go upon, Mr. Black,
who was a keen student of human nature,
had seen the whole thing as plain as a picture
before his eyes, even to the understanding
of the “certain reasons.” He
felt sure that the need of money had been
the reason—a <i>motif</i> for literary effort
known to him all too well. There was no
indication in either the letter or the manuscript
of even the faintest stirring of the
divine afflatus of literary creation. There
was no hint of any desire for fame. It
was distinctly, and he felt sure, honestly,
owned, that the writer had emptied herself
in this story, and would be incapable
of doing anything further. Of all the incentives
to writing known to him, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
need of money was the only one that fitted
this case. And how powerful must that
need have been to have caused a woman
to write her heart out, as this woman had
done here.</p>

<p>The story, if it could be called a story,
was absolutely without literary form, and
so unfinished in style that no magazine
could have ventured to print it. And yet
there breathed through it such an exquisite
soul of sweetness, such a spirit of refinement,
purity, innocence, aspiration and
charm, that Mr. Black was tempted to
ask her to re-cast the manuscript, leave
out the poor attempt at plot, and let the
subtle self-analysis appear in the form of
entries in a journal, or letters, or something
of that sort. There were two reasons
against this, though—one was, that
he felt that the girl would have been incapable
of doing what he wanted, and
would simply have made a mess of it; and
the other was, that he positively shrank
from exposing to public view the secrets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
of the heart of this young girl. For the
keynote of this poor story of hers was the
aspiration of a young, innocent, and ardent
woman after love. What it described was
the hardships of a lot keenly interpenetrated
with pain, full of privation of body
and soul, obscured by perplexities and difficulties
on every side, and yet sweetened,
illuminated, glorified, by the possibility of
the attainment of the supreme good, which,
to this being, at least, was to be found only
in love. Here was a creature, if ever
words painted truth, whose waiting heart
was kept both strong and pure by the sanctification
of that hope. The manuscript
proved beyond a doubt, that, though she
could not write, she could love!</p>

<p>Mr. Black had laid it down, with tenderness
and regret, and had rather sadly
gone about the task of writing her a note
to be sent with the returned manuscript.
He had had to harden his heart to this
sort of thing so often, that he did not
flinch from the plain duty before him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
he would not lead this girl to believe that
she could ever write. What he felt like
telling her was, that he found himself positively
grateful to her for the self-revelation
of so pure a heart and so strong a spirit.
This, of course, he was not at liberty to
express; but he said what he could to
soften the blow to her, and he put aside
to be returned to the author the manuscript,
which was beautifully written (on
both sides of the paper, however), and tied
with a bit of blue ribbon.</p>

<p>Then he took up the next manuscript,
and, to his relief, found it to be in a man’s
handwriting. It would help him, he hoped,
to efface the impression which its predecessor
had made on him. This strong and
vigorous writing was unknown to him also,
and Mr. Black began to read, with that
stirring of possibilities which rises in the
jaded mind of the editor at the sight of the
work of a perfectly new contributor, and
which ninety-nine times out of a hundred
ends in disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>This case proved not to be the exceptional
one, for this manuscript possessed
the same faults of inexperience and lack of
literary form as the last one. The letter
that accompanied it furnished a further
coincidence, in the fact that it acknowledged
the use of a <i>nom de guerre</i>, and that
the present was the first effort of the
writer, who, for certain reasons, had been
impelled to write this one story, and would
probably never write another. The
motive, however, in this case, must have
been a different one; for this man, who
called himself Hugh Robertson, said that he
didn’t think his story worth paying for;
(This made Mr. Black smile. Could it
then be worth publishing?) but he would
like to have it come out in this magazine,
because its circulation was so large that,
in that way, it would reach a great number
of readers.</p>

<p>And what, then, was the message for
which this Hugh Robertson desired such
a wide audience? Mr. Black read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
manuscript attentively, and then, after a
brief study of the man, as his character
was indicated in his note and his handwriting,
he constructed his theory of the
case. Here was a man, strong, able, successful,
surrounded by conditions of prosperity
and ease which flatly contradicted
the case of Ethel Ross—and yet the
keynote to this soul, too, was the all-powerful
one of love. Between the two
there was a difference, however, for the
woman’s heart was attuned to aspiration
and the man’s to renunciation. The message
from the woman’s heart was that
every trial and earthly evil could be borne
without complaint, so long as there remained
the possibility of the fulfilment of
ideal love. The message from the man’s
heart was that the fulfilment of ideal love
was so well-nigh impossible a thing
(though every other fulfilment which the
world could give was scant joy in comparison
with it), that it behooved one to
learn earnestly the lesson of resignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
without cynicism. The man’s voice was
the stronger of the two, and his message
was the nobler, but then there was every
indication of its being the outcome of a
maturer mind.</p>

<p>It had been as Mr. Black laid down the
second manuscript that he had uttered the
exclamation already recorded, and the
thing that struck him as so very extraordinary
was the subtle sort of answering to
each other’s needs which these two manuscripts
conveyed to his mind. The
man’s was as obviously a self-revelation
as the woman’s; and the perspicacious
editor shrewdly suspected him of being a
very shy man, who would not have been
able to express himself fully and freely in
his own person, and who had therefore
sought this means of saying what he had
to say to as large an audience as he could
reach. Mr. Black could not quite explain
why he felt it so, but, in reality, he was
convinced that this was a man of influence
and importance, who lived a life of active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
labor, in which he was able to express
himself objectively, but who was now, for
the first time, giving his soul a subjective
expression in this manuscript. The address
given by Hugh Robertson was in a
great and populous city. It was also in a
locality not very far away from the little
town from which Ethel Ross had dated
her letter. Mr. Black reflected on this
fact rather wistfully. He wished that this
man and this woman could meet. He
could hardly have been the judge of fiction
that he was, without a certain amount of
romance in him; but, on the other hand,
he had an equal amount of common sense,
and he saw that the obvious and practical
duty of the present moment was to guard
the confidence of his contributors in the
discharge of his functions as editor.</p>

<p>So he drew a sheet of paper toward
him, and wrote his letter to Hugh Robertson.
It was much shorter and more
restrained than the former one, for no one
could fail to recognize in this man a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
quite able to stand on his own feet,
and yet Mr. Black felt conscious of a regret
in this instance, too. A man so
strongly capable of renouncing seemed to
him the very man who deserved to possess.</p>

<p>Before he had quite finished, he was
interrupted by a pressing business demand,
so he thrust both the finished and unfinished
letters into the drawer of his desk,
together with the letters to which they
were the answers. Before he left the
room, he called one of his assistants and
delivered to him the two manuscripts, to
be put up for return, and giving the addresses,
told the clerk to send on the
manuscripts, and he would forward, later
in the day, his letters to the two authors.</p>

<p>He hurried away from the room then,
and the clerk took the two manuscripts
into the outer office, put them up with
great precision and care, and in all unconsciousness
sent Hugh Robertson’s manuscript
to Ethel Ross, and Ethel Ross’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
manuscript to Hugh Robertson. He had
understood Mr. Black’s very explicit directions,
but, in putting up and sealing the
two parcels, he had mixed them.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that when Miss
Ethel Ross—whose real name, in full,
was Ethel Ross Duncan—went on her
daily mission to the little postoffice of the
small country town, she received one day,
not the envelope containing a check,
for which she so mightily longed, but
a bulky package, which made her very
young and ardent heart sink low within
her. She really had not expected to have
her story returned. It had seemed to her,
as she had written it with breathless agitation,
in stolen moments, alone in her
chamber at night, so palpitatingly interesting,
that, as she had ended it, she had
felt a positive certainty of seeing those
thrilling words turned into print, and of
having, in exchange for it, a check which
should be large enough for her to carry
out a passionate desire of her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>It was with difficulty that she could
repress her tears as she took the package,
which had suddenly become so stale and
poor and worthless a thing, and walked
homeward with it.</p>

<p>It could hardly be called a home to
which she was going back, for she had
neither father nor mother to give that
sacred character to the shabby little house
she now approached. But this house
contained, all the same, the being who
was at once the source of the sweetest
pleasure and the keenest pain in her young
life. This was her little brother, who,
long ago, had had an injury from a fall,
and who had been an invalid and a cripple
ever since. The whole responsibility of
his care, as well as his support, was upon
Ethel, and she had been able to discharge
it by means of a position in the village
school, which paid her just enough for the
bare living of the two. For years her
brother’s case had been considered hopeless,
and the local doctor, saying he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
could do no good, had not kept up his visits.
Lately, however, Ethel had heard of wonderful
things achieved by a distinguished
surgeon in a great city not far away, and
it had now became an ardent hope in her
heart to take little Bob there. She confided
this wish to the woman with whom
they boarded, but the rural mind is slow
to catch enthusiasm, and she had only responded
by saying that it would take more
money than ever she could scrape together.
Ethel had managed to save a little by
great economy, and she calculated that
this would cover the traveling expenses,
if only she could get from somewhere
enough to pay the doctor.</p>

<p>This had been the spur that had led her
to make that desperate effort with the
story, and to lay bare the deepest and
most sacred feelings of her heart. She
was a very reserved girl, and she never
could have done it, but for the safety of
distance, and the protection of a name that
was not her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Well, she had done it, and done it conscientiously.
She had “dipped her pen
in herself” and written out of her own
heart, and this was the result—to have
the record of her soul-life returned with
thanks, or perhaps without them. She
felt no interest in opening the packet, and
went and thrust it out of sight in the back
of a drawer in her own room as soon as
she reached the house. Bob was in pain,
and he called to her crossly, and complained
because she had left him. He
was often impatient with her, and she generally
bore it sweetly; but to-day it cut
and irritated her.</p>

<p>She said nothing, however, as she took
off her hat and came to the side of the
couch where he was lying. The child
looked up and saw tears in her eyes, and
his face and tone grew more resentful
still.</p>

<p>“What are you crying about?” he
said. “What business have <i>you</i> to cry,
when you are well and strong, and you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
walk and run and go about wherever you
please, and never have an ache or a pain?
And then you have the ‘cheek’ to tell me
to be brave, and to bear my pain, and not
to cry!”</p>

<p>“O Bobby, you are right!” she said.
“I ought not to cry and be a coward, and
I <i>am</i> ashamed of it; but something has
happened that has disappointed me so
dreadfully. However, I’ll try to be brave
about it, and remember the lessons I have
tried to teach to you. I wish I could
help you—poor little Bob! It <i>is</i> awful,
<i>awful</i>, to have to suffer all the time as you
do; but, at least, you don’t suffer in your
mind—do you? You know I always
take care of you and make you as comfortable
as I can. Tell me that, Bobby,
for it comforts me more than anything in
the world to think of that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I know you will take care
of me,” said the child; “but is nobody
ever going to do anything to make me any
better? Am I going to lie and suffer all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
my life, and never be strong and well like
other boys?”</p>

<p>“O Bobby, I don’t know! I don’t
know!” said the poor girl, remembering,
with a pang, the failure of the only effort
it had been in her power to make. “I want
to take you to the city to see that great
doctor, for I think he might be able to
help you. I will do it, if I ever can, but
poor sister can do so little to make
money, and it takes money to do a thing
like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said the boy, with a
certain change in his tone. “When I was
little, I used to think I’d make money for
you. I used to say you were too pretty
to work, and that I would work for you.
When Mother died and the pension stopped,
I thought if you’d work for me a little
while, I’d soon be able to work for you,
and I would have done it, if I had not had
that fall. Oh, why didn’t it kill me at
once! I wish it had!”</p>

<p>“No, my Bobby, no!” said Ethel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
bending over him and drawing his arm
around her neck. “If you had died, poor
sister would have had no one in the world
to love; and that would be the worst
thing that could happen to anybody.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so bad as being lame,” said
the boy.</p>

<p>“O Bobby, I think it’s worse!” said
Ethel, half involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Then it shows how much you know
about it!” said Bobby; and Ethel made
haste to soothe and reassure him, and tell
him how much she sympathized with his
trouble, and stifled back the wish that he,
or somebody, could sympathize with hers.</p>

<p>When night came at last, and the child
had gone to sleep, and Ethel was alone in
her little room that opened into his, she
softly closed the door between them, and
gave herself up to the luxury of a good
cry. It was one of the few luxuries
within her reach; she did not often indulge
herself in this, but to-night she felt
she must. It was this craving for sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
which brought it on her—the passionate
wish that somebody understood
her and was aware of the struggle she
made continually, by day and by night, to
still the craving of her heart for love. She
loved Bobby, but he was an unceasing
care to her, and she wanted somebody to
care for her, as she cared for him. If she
had, how ardently grateful would she be
for such care and protection—and how
little he seemed to respond to or appreciate
it! Of course, it was not to be expected
of a crippled boy, continually preoccupied
by pain, and, as a rule, she never thought
of expecting it. But to-night she felt that
need of being understood swelling up
within her so passionately, that it seemed
almost more than she could bear.</p>

<p>When she had cried until there seemed
to be no more tears left to shed, she got
up and went to the old dressing-table
to prepare for bed. She looked at herself,
half bitterly, as she realized how useless
all those foolish tears had been. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
might as well make up her mind that her
lot in life was to be drudgery and disappointment,
and that no one would ever
really understand her or enter into the
feelings of her heart.</p>

<p>She pulled open a drawer to get something
out, and as she did so she remembered
the manuscript. She took it out
and looked at the cold, unsympathetic
typewriting on the back. It was foolish
of her to shrink from opening it, and she
would compel herself to look once more at
those poor pages which she had written
with such heart throbbings, and sent off
with such hopes.</p>

<p>Running a hairpin along the edge of the
sealed envelope, she cut it open and drew
the contents out. How was this? They
looked unfamiliar. There was no binding
with blue ribbons, no delicate woman-writing.
Instead, she held in her hands a
number of loose sheets covered with the
strong, distinct, nervous characters of a
man’s hand. The title of this manuscript<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
was <i>The Draught Divine</i>. The title of
hers had been <i>The Soul-Thirst</i>. The caption
under the title was exactly the one
that she had put under hers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The thirst which from the soul doth rise</div>
<div class="indent">Doth ask a draught divine.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>But for this coincidence she would
probably have suspected some mistake at
the editorial office and put the manuscript
by; but after seeing this, she felt that she
must read it.</p>

<p>And so, standing fascinated where she
was, she turned leaf after leaf, and read
breathlessly on. As she did so, the old
mirror opposite reflected a picture whose
glowing beauty deepened every minute.
Here, the divine draught of love was so
strongly analyzed, its component parts so
comprehendingly described, and its powerful
effects so brilliantly demonstrated, that
the paper had almost the character of a
scientific treatise. The subject, she felt,
could scarcely have been handled in this
deliberate way but for the very fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the writer was in an attitude, not of anticipation,
but of renunciation. It mattered
little to Ethel that the plot of this story
was ill-constructed and illogical, and the
situations commonplace and trite. What
she saw before her on these sheets, and
felt permeating every corner of her soul,
was the renunciation of all the ideal conditions
of living and loving that her heart
aspired to. What this man gave up was
what she had always so resolutely claimed—what
she had never wavered in demanding
and expecting of life, until this very
evening, when, for the first time, she had
looked in the face of possible renunciation.</p>

<p>But with the reading of this paper she
shifted back to her old ground, for here,
at least, she felt herself comprehended at
last. Not one of all the people with
whom her lot had hitherto been cast had
ever uttered thoughts and feelings such as
these; but here, in this manuscript, were
the very echoes of her own soul. Yes, all
of them—the loud, sonorous, reverberating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
ones, no less than the delicate soundings
of her finest needs. She looked at
the signature at the end, and saw the
words, “Hugh Robertson.” This gave an
individual character to the consciousness
that had just entered into her, and the mere
knowledge of the existence of such a personality
in the world was a stimulating
and an exhilarating thought that made her
smile.</p>

<p>As she did so, she looked up and caught
the reflection of herself in the mirror
before her. Happiness, the supreme
beautifier, had swiftly done its wonder-work,
and she could not fail to realise
that she was very fair to see. The
knowledge of it gave her pleasure. The
power of enjoyment, lately so stultified
and depressed, returned to her with a
glowing ardor. All the world began suddenly
to look more hopeful. Ah, life
was sweet, its opportunities were great
and precious, its possibilities were divine!</p>

<p>As these thoughts darted through her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
mind and illuminated her beautiful face
there came a sudden recollection which
checked the first and clouded the second—the
thought of Bob with his sad burden
of pain and helplessness. Oh, how dreadful
that such things could be! Couldn’t
it be helped? she wondered. Couldn’t
something be done? Somehow, a new
power seemed to have come into her—a
power of initiative and action, such as she
had never felt before. She suddenly determined
that she would write to the great
doctor, of whose skill she had heard so
much, and ask him if he would examine
Bob if she brought him on, and tell her
what could be done. The incentive was so
strong that she got her desk and wrote the
letter at once, explaining that she had no
money now, except enough for the bare
expenses of the trip, but adding that, if
treatment could be had for Bob at a moderate
cost, she might hope to save the
money for it, if she could pay a little at a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>She finished the letter, and addressed it
in her delicate, characteristic hand to Dr.
Arthur H. Hubert, but there she had to
stop. It would be necessary to wait until
she could get his address.</p>

<p>Ethel waked next morning with a feeling
of renewed youth, for which she
could not account, until she recollected
the manuscript, which, in her ardent way,
she had slipped under her pillow, before
going to sleep. Perhaps it was to that
cause that she was indebted for some very
sweet and joy-giving dreams, in which she
had lived in such a rose-colored world
that, even in returning to the sombreness
of the actual one, she brought with her a
portion of that lovely hue.</p>

<p>To-day’s mail brought her Mr. Black’s
letter, and made it perfectly clear that this
manuscript had been sent her by mistake,
instead of her own. The kind words in
the letter helped and strengthened her, and
the reading of the manuscript had given
her such joy that she felt the sting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
failure of her own half obliterated. She
sat down and wrote to Mr. Black, telling
him of the mistake, and asking him to
give her the address of Hugh Robertson,
so that she might send his manuscript to
him and ask for her own back, if he
should, as she supposed, have received
hers. She knew that the more regular
way would be to send the manuscript
back to Mr. Black; but the fact was, she
hated to part with it, and she resorted to
this means of keeping it a little longer.
She was too refined a girl to have any idea
of getting up an acquaintance with the
writer of the story in this way, and it
would never have occurred to her to do
more than let him know that she had
read it. That, she thought, she might do,
though she did not mention the fact to
Mr. Black.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the receipt of her
letter Mr. Black wrote and asked that the
manuscript might be returned to him,
apologizing for the mistake. He said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
addresses of his contributors were a matter
of professional confidence, and he felt
bound, therefore, to return the manuscript
himself. He made many apologies for
having also, through a fault in his office,
sent her manuscript to Hugh Robertson,
and added that he had just received from
that gentleman a request for her address,
to which he had replied in the same terms
as those of his letter to her. As soon as
he received her manuscript he would forward
it to her, he said.</p>

<p>What he did not say, however, was,
that the clerk who had made the mistake
had been let off with a lighter reprimand
than was usual with Mr. Black, who
somehow felt that if he said too much he
might be tampering with the designs of
Providence.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubert sat alone in his office opening
his mail—a great pile of letters and
papers and medical journals, relative
chiefly to his practice and the working
of his hospital. Many of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
who wrote to the celebrated surgeon from
a distance were much surprised, when they
came to see him, to find him so young a
man. The great success of his surgical
practice had brought him almost suddenly
into notice and prominence, and now,
although he was under forty, he had a
well-established and very successful hospital
of his own. He was unmarried,
despite the fact of such decided personal
attractions as made him almost an idol
with the ladies; and the current belief was,
that he had been “disappointed in love.”
Although this fact was generally accepted,
no one had ever been able to identify the
object of this theory. If the more intimate
of his friends and patients ventured
to question him on this point, he would
laughingly defy them to point out the lady;
but, confident as he was of their inability
to do this, he acknowledged, to his own
heart, at least, that it was literally true that
he had been “disappointed in love.” That
was exactly it. No loved woman had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
ever disappointed him, but his feelings
came from the fact that love itself had
disappointed him; and the little god,
though long expected and looked for, had
resolutely turned his back and looked the
other way. So now, at last, Dr. Hubert
had made up his mind to be independent
of Cupid; and having spent much of his
force in restless watching and wooing of
him, he had determined to secure a greater
power of concentration in his profession
by bidding him farewell. He was essentially
a deliberate and methodical man,
however; and as it was his habit to study
and investigate every theory and practice
of medicine and surgery before he either
accepted or rejected it, and even to formulate
his grounds of action in writing, he
had written out his theory of love, and
formulated to himself the grounds of his
rejection of it. The chief reason for this
rejection was the difficulty, if not the impossibility,
of realizing his ideal. Dr.
Hubert was an intensely energetic man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and the great secret of his success had
been in his excellent discrimination between
the attainable and unattainable. So in
his profession he left the province of abstract
and experimental theories to less
active men, and only worked along the
lines that gave promise of definite results.
He was very ambitious in his profession,
and he knew that he had so long served it
with a divided heart, that he now proposed
to do in the matter of love what he had
done in all other departments, and give up
a search for what plainly appeared to be
the unattainable.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it had occurred to him to
make the matter more impersonal by writing
his thesis on renunciation in the form
of a story, and, having written it, to
publish it under a <i>nom de guerre</i>, and send
it to a journal with a large circulation.
He was accustomed to having his papers
considered important, and he had never
written one that appeared to him more so
than this. Moreover, he had an absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
horror of wasted force in any department,
and he wanted this paper to be
widely read. The message which he delivered
in it was a warning to men, and
women too, not to spend their best energies
in a restless seeking after love, but,
rather, after a reasonable amount of time
and force had been put into the quest, to
make a strong act of renunciation, and to
have their faculties unimpeded for whatever
work they could find to do.</p>

<p>This was the story which he had sent
to Mr. Black’s magazine, and which, with
Mr. Black’s usual admirable promptness,
had been returned to him, as he supposed.
But, lo! upon opening the envelope he had
found another manuscript, written in the
beautiful handwriting of a refined woman,
tied with a bit of blue ribbon, and having
a title strongly allied to his own, and a
sub-title that was identical.</p>

<p>Of course he read the manuscript. He
began it with interest, which increased to
eagerness, and ended in avidity. Whoever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Ethel Ross might be, she had a soul that
answered his; a heart that gave back to
his heart, throb for throb. He had dashed
off a note to Mr. Black, asking for her
address, that he might return the manuscript
to its author, and Mr. Black had
sent him, by this post, the letter in which
he had declined to give the address, and
had asked that the manuscript might be
returned to him.</p>

<p>This was the letter which Dr. Hubert
had singled out of the pile before him,
recognizing it by the name of the magazine
printed in the corner, and pushing all his
other mail aside.</p>

<p>He read the letter twice, with a look of
distinct disappointment on his face, but
mingled with it there was a look of strong
determination. He was in the habit of
overcoming difficulties, and he did not
purpose to let himself be conquered here.
He put Mr. Black’s communication in a
drawer, and drew the remainder of his letters
toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>He read them rapidly through, putting
them by to be answered by his stenographer
in the evening, until he came to the one at
the bottom of the pile. When he saw
the address on this letter, he started. All
the rest he had read with business-like
composure, but now his face actually flushed.
The handwriting looked familiar; its character
was peculiar, and he had seen it
before—he knew where.</p>

<p>He hastily cut it open and turned to the
signature. It was “Ethel R. Duncan.”
What could it mean? Had she, perchance,
read his manuscript, too, and more successful
than he, obtained his address and written
to him? These questions were soon
answered by the reading of the letter.</p>

<p>He found himself addressed simply in
his capacity as physician, and the whole
tone of the letter was that of a young
person speaking to an elder. This grated
on him a little, but it was a mere detail,
and the main point was, that he found the
coveted opportunity, which he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
prepared to do much to win, just within
his grasp.</p>

<p>He held the letter in his hand a moment,
and then opening a drawer, and taking out
the manuscript eagerly, identified the writing.
There could not be a shadow of a
doubt. This letter proposed to give him
immediately the power to make her acquaintance,
by coming on to his hospital
at once, and bringing her little brother to
him for treatment. This was her wish
and design, provided the very scanty means
which she acknowledged should not be an
obstacle. One point that she made, was
the necessity for immediate action, as her
school was to re-open in three weeks, and
she, at least, would have to return.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubert drew a sheet of paper
toward him at once, and wrote to Miss
Duncan, taking the tone that it was the
most natural thing in the world for people
to bring patients to his hospital without
any prospect of paying for their treatment,
and urging her not to lose a day in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
bringing her brother on, saying that the
financial part of the transaction could all
be settled at some future time, when it
had been seen whether or not the patient
could be benefitted. This he left to be
copied on the typewriter.</p>

<p>Then he wrote a very light and easy
letter to Mr. Black, and with the utmost
propriety returned the manuscript. He
had fancied that it would be a great trial
to him to give up that little packet of paper
but now, with the opportunity which he
had in view, he could let it go willingly,
especially as every word of it was inscribed
on his heart.</p>

<p>These two matters disposed of, Dr.
Hubert got into his buggy, and had himself
driven to the hospital. It was not
his usual time for coming, and the matron
and nurses were thrown into quite a little
flutter of surprise at seeing him. He soon
explained, however, that he had only come
to give explicit orders that Number 29
was not to be given to any one, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
wished it reserved for a patient whom he
was expecting in a day or two. This was
his favorite room in the hospital; its wallpaper,
furniture, and situation were the
very best in the house, and the price of it
corresponded to this fact.</p>

<p>When Dr. Hubert sprang into his buggy
again, there was a buoyancy in his manner
which was unusual, even to this energetic
man. A little later, as he came
suddenly in view of a florist’s window, he
put out his hand and jerked up the horse
suddenly, to the driver’s surprise, and went
into the shop. When he came out, he
had a rose in his button-hole, and a big
bunch of carnations in his hands. These
he smelt with evident pleasure, from time
to time, finally bestowing them on a little
crippled boy who was one of his patients.</p>

<p>By return of post Dr. Hubert got a
letter announcing the day and hour on
which the new patient and his sister might
be expected.</p>

<p>On that day and hour he sent one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
his young assistant physicians to the station
to meet the brother and sister, explaining
that they had been very especially
commended to his care, and that, as the
boy was lame, the young lady might require
assistance in moving him.</p>

<p>As he uttered the words “young lady,”
the possibility crossed his mind that the
adjective might possibly be proved to be a
mistake. Suppose, after all, she should
turn out to be elderly, unlovable, and unbeautiful!
He laughed to himself, in ardent
rejection of the idea. Such a woman
might well have been the author of those
two letters, which were models of stiff
propriety and reserve, but such a woman
could never be the author of that manuscript.
When he remembered the free
expression of vivid thought and ardent
feeling that that story had contained, he
felt a positive certainty that the being who
had written it would prove to be both
young and lovely.</p>

<p>And both young and lovely did she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
prove. When “The Doctor,” as he was
called by all the inmates of the hospital,
whether they served and worshipped him
as employees or as patients, arrived that
afternoon, he paid every visit that was due
on the premises before he went to Number
29. These visits were unusually
brief, however, and as he consulted his
watch before tapping at that door, he saw
that he had managed well, and had left
himself plenty of time to be deliberate in
the examination of this patient and the
talking over of his case with his sister.</p>

<p>Certainly it was a youthful voice that
called, “Come in,” in answer to his knock.
He came in, accordingly, and closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p>He was a very handsome man, this
doctor, and very young for his great reputation.
He stood just within the threshold,
with his hands resting on his hips in
an attitude of much natural grace. Then
he bowed politely and took in the two occupants
of the room with a keen and concentrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
gaze, through a pair of very
light and polished glasses.</p>

<p>The crippled boy was lying on the bed,
and a beautiful, blooming, vigorous young
girl was sitting by him in an attitude of
expectation, and with a look upon her face
that was tinged with a shy timidity. The
doctor did not speak at first, having a
fancy that she should open the conversation.
She stood up, in evident hesitation
what to do, and then said:</p>

<p>“Did you want to speak to me about
anything?”</p>

<p>“I fancied you wanted to speak to me,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You are, perhaps, one of the doctors,”
said Ethel, not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m one of the doctors,” he
said, looking at her keenly all the time,
with a self-possession which she found it
impossible to imitate. She was so confused,
in fact, that she could think of nothing
to say but, “Which one?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Hubert,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Oh, are there two Dr. Huberts?”
she asked. “I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“There is but one Dr. Hubert, so far
as I know,” he said. “Why do you object
to my being he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, really!” said the girl, blushing.
“Please excuse me. I thought he would
be an old man.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he ain’t. I hate old men!”
put in Bobby, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, my boy,” said
the doctor, advancing to the bed-side.
“Your sister, it seems, is disappointed in
me. I am afraid I will have to make a
big effort to build up her confidence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! It isn’t that,” said
Ethel, eagerly; but he was plainly not
attending to her words, as he bent over
the bed and looked scrutinizingly into the
boy’s face, and then took one of the small,
thin hands into his, and held it in a watchful
sort of way as he turned to the girl and
said, with earnest interest:</p>

<p>“Is his general health pretty good?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Oh, yes, I think so,” began Ethel;
but the child interrupted her, roughly:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you think so!” he said. “As
if you knew how I suffer! You never
have an ache or a pain, and you don’t care
how <i>I</i> feel!”</p>

<p>Ethel was about to speak, when the
doctor, catching Bobby by the chin and
looking intently into his eyes, said firmly:</p>

<p>“Now look here, my youngster, I’m
going to put a stop to this at once—do
you understand? I’m not going to
have your sister spoken to in any such a
way as that. She’s your best friend, and
she seems to be a good enough one for
any boy alive, and I’d like to see you treat
her with a little respect, if you please.”</p>

<p>The boy flushed deeply as he realized
the impression that he had made upon this
new doctor, from whom he hoped so much.
He was very angry with himself, and said
quickly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think I don’t love her,
or know how good she is to me. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
think so, you are wrong. I love her better
than all the world, and I know there never
was such a good sister; but she doesn’t
mind. She knows how I suffer, and she
lets me talk to her like that, when the pain
is very bad.”</p>

<p>There were tears of regret and mortification
in his eyes as he spoke, seeing which
the doctor’s face grew suddenly very gentle.</p>

<p>“I know how you suffer, even better
than she does,” he said; “but until I can
relieve the suffering, as I hope to do,
<i>I</i> am not going to let you talk to her like
that, both because it must hurt her feelings
and because it is unkind and unmanly of you.
I know you well enough already to feel
sure that you want to bear your troubles
like a man, and I am going to help you to
do it.”</p>

<p>With what infinite comfort did Ethel
listen to these words! She had found her
poor little brother’s tempers almost more
than she could battle with at times, and
for his own sake she had longed to correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
them, but no one had ever given her any
help before. Indeed, it was a new thing
to her to be helped in any way, and never
had she recognized in any human being
such a power of helpfulness as she had
already divined to be in this man. She
looked at Bobby keenly to see if he appeared
to be irritated and angry; but,
instead of showing a spirit of peevishness
and antagonism toward the person who had
given him so decided a rebuke, she saw
that the child’s eyes were fixed upon the
doctor with a look of strong confidence
and affectionate appeal.</p>

<p>“Can you make me well?” he said.</p>

<p>“That is more than I can tell you yet,”
the doctor answered; “but I will do my
part, if you do yours. You know, and I
know, that this good sister of yours will
do hers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that better than you,”
said Bobby; “but what is my part?”</p>

<p>“To be patient and manly, and to do
what you are told. Can you do that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“I can try,” said Bobby, wistfully.</p>

<p>“That is all that any of us can do—try
our best. And now, Miss Duncan,
if you will do me the kindness to go to
the matron’s room, at the end of this hall,
and tell her to send Dr. Lawson to me
here, at once, I will see what is the trouble
with this little man. If you will also
stay with Mrs. Mills until I send for you
to return, you will have the chance to
make acquaintance with a very kind and
motherly woman, whom you will find prepared
to render you any help or service
that may be in her power, while you are
in the house.”</p>

<p>Ethel got up at once, but before
leaving she said, while her face grew suddenly
white and anxious:</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what you are going
to do?”</p>

<p>“Only to make an examination,” he
said, gently. “I will not hurt him.”</p>

<p>Oh, how grateful it was to her heart to
find that he cared—cared about hurting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Bobby’s body, and cared about hurting
her feelings! As the girl left the room
and walked down the wide and beautifully
clean and bright hall, she was conscious
for the first time since childhood of being
helped and taken care of, and of having her
load of responsibility shared by another.</p>

<p>At the end of about twenty minutes of
pleasant talk with Mrs. Mills, a pretty
little nurse, with snowy cap and apron,
appeared, and with the manner of suppressed
agitation, which usually characterized
in this establishment those who were
the bearers of messages from “The
Doctor,” she summoned Ethel to an
audience with that august individual in
his private office.</p>

<p>When Ethel knocked at the door of
this attractive room, it was promptly
opened from within, and Dr. Hubert,
after having closed the door behind her,
led her to a chair and sat down facing her.
He then began asking her very searching
and detailed particulars as to the fall which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Bobby had had, and, when he had ended
these, he added:</p>

<p>“And, now, you would like to ask me
some questions, would you not? You
want to know the result of my examination?”</p>

<p>“If you want to tell me,” she said. “I
am willing to know as much or as little as
you wish.”</p>

<p>“You have confidence in me, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have, indeed,” said Ethel, “absolute
confidence!”</p>

<p>“That is good!—but, this confidence—when
did it come to you? From what
you have heard of me, or from what you
have seen?”</p>

<p>“A good deal from what I have heard,
but more from what I have seen. I knew
you were a great doctor, but now I know
you are good and kind.”</p>

<p>“You trust me, then, about your
brother? You believe that I will do my
utmost for him and for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do!” said Ethel, earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Then let me tell you, my dear child,
that I feel very certain that I can help him
and relieve him of much of the pain, but I
have no certainty of curing him. The
most that I can do is to help nature out,
and wait for results. The treatment will
be long, but will inevitably do much good
and relieve the pain; I ask nothing, but that
you will leave the case to me. Will you?”</p>

<p>“How can you ask? How can I be
anything but glad and thankful to do it?”
said Ethel, the tears springing to her eyes.
“But I have told you—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he interrupted her,
“we needn’t speak about that now. If
you leave the matter to me, you must
leave it to me wholly. All that is my
affair. I often wait indefinitely for my
pay, and it really isn’t such an expensive
matter as you may suppose. But, as I
said before, you must do your part. You
must stay here with Bobby, and take care
of and amuse him. That will do away
with the need of a special nurse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Of course I will—until my school
begins,” said Ethel. “Then I will be
obliged to go. That is a matter of life
and death to Bobby, and me, too.”</p>

<p>“And how long before that does begin?”</p>

<p>“Three weeks,” said Ethel, in a tone
that was half desperate.</p>

<p>“Three weeks!” said the doctor, quickly.
“That is plenty of time to arrange for the
future; and now all you have got to do is to
be as happy as you can, say your prayers,
and leave the rest to me. Now, you can
go and see Bobby. I told Lawson to
stay with him until you came.”</p>

<p>He got up and opened the door for her,
as he spoke, and, without knowing why,
she carried away a strong impression of
charm and strength from the pose of his
figure, as he held the door open for her.
He was a trained athlete, and not the
least part of his personal attractiveness
was in his exceptionally handsome figure.</p>

<p>The next day, Bobby was put under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
chloroform, and an operation was performed.
Ethel was sent to Mrs. Mills’ room
during this time, and when at last a message
arrived for her to come, she found her little
brother stretched out very straight and
stiff upon a bed, waiting for the plaster
jacket, in which he had been cased, to
harden. He was still unconscious, but
the doctor, who met her at the door, prepared
her for a comprehension of everything,
by telling her that it was “all
right,” and that he was more convinced
than ever of being able to do Bobby good.
The doctor himself was in his working
clothes of immaculate white linen, a
costume in which those who had been
privileged to see him, declared that he
looked his very best; and when he bent
over Bobby, and took the trouble to explain
to Ethel what he had done in the
way of straightening and righting things,
she felt as if he were a sort of strong good
spirit, who had both power and will to
lessen the woes of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Ethel had feared that the effect of the
plaster would be to make the boy, at first,
at least, more uncomfortable; but to her
delight, she found that the support which
it gave was an intense relief to him, and
that he seemed every hour to be growing
better in body and in mind. The doctor’s
influence over him was simply unbounded,
and a tremendous reformation had evidently
begun in temper and disposition.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a few days later, Ethel
was sitting telling Bobby a story, when
there came a knock at the door. She
called “Come in,” and to her surprise it
was the doctor who entered, although it
was out of his usual hospital hours. He
wore a long overcoat of tan-colored cloth,
had a flower in his button-hole, and held an
immaculate top-hat in his gloved hand.
Ethel quite started. She had never seen
such an imposing gentleman as this, outside
of a picture, before.</p>

<p>“I have come to give you a little airing,”
he said; “you need it, I am sure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Will you put on your wraps and come
down as soon as you are ready? I want
to take you to the park.”</p>

<p>Then he turned and put his gloved
thumb on the button of the electric bell,
and, in a moment, a tidy nurse appeared.</p>

<p>“Are you on special duty, this afternoon?”
he asked; and having a negative
reply, went on: “Then find some storybooks
or toys and come and amuse this
child, if you please. I am going to take
Miss Duncan for a little airing.”</p>

<p>When Ethel, five minutes later, came
downstairs, she found the doctor waiting
in the hall, while several people—nurses,
patients, etc.—were trying to get a word
with him.</p>

<p>But he waved them off, shaking his
head and shutting his eyes, with a smile
of obstinate dismissal of their claims.</p>

<p>“I am off duty now,” he said; “all
these things must wait, or you must go to
the other doctors. Come, Miss Duncan,”
and he led the way down the long hall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
As he opened the door for Ethel to go
out, she saw, drawn up before the pavement,
a handsome drag, with a pair of
superb horses, glittering with their heavy
harnesses, and with a groom in top-boots
standing at their heads.</p>

<p>As she was helped into this imposing
equipage, which was as far removed from
anything in her former experience as the
coach and six was from Cinderella’s, the
doctor gathered up the reins, while the
groom sprang into his place behind, and
they started off over the noisy cobblestones
at a swinging pace.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, they had left the
city streets behind, and were bowling
along at ease over the smooth roads of the
beautiful park. And then what delightful
talk they had! How her companion drew
her out, and provoked her to charming
and spontaneous chatter! She was a
rather countrified little creature, in spite
of her beauty, and perhaps some of the
fashionable people, who bowed to Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Hubert in passing, wondered at the shape
of her little black hat, and the cut of her
dark cloth jacket. If they did, she never
suspected it; and if her companion did, it
must have troubled him very little, for he
had a gleam of positive exultation in his
eyes.</p>

<p>It was a memorable drive to them both,
and there was such a feeling of spontaneous
freedom and confidence in the girl’s heart,
that, when she got back to Bobby at last,
she felt as if she had really known this
charming, friendly doctor the whole of
her natural life.</p>

<p>“And so you have!” he said to her,
next day, when, having sent for her to
come to his office, she had made this same
remark to him. “I really believe we
have known each other always. It only
remained for us to meet in bodily presence.
But what I sent for you to-day
was, to tell you that I had leisure now to
listen to what you said you had to tell me
about your future plans. I checked you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
then, but now I want to hear what it is.
Tell me.”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to remind you that I
must go away very soon,” she began.</p>

<p>“You can’t go; Bobby needs you,”
said the doctor, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I know it. I don’t see what I am to
do. I can go back and send a little
money from my salary for his weekly
board, but that seems almost preposterous.”</p>

<p>“The idea of your leaving seems preposterous,”
he said. “I really can’t let
you go. The school must go to the
wall.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how can you talk so?” she said.
“It’s the first time that you have seemed
uncomprehending.”</p>

<p>“I am not uncomprehending,” he said;
“I am only thinking hard how I can
make you comprehend.”</p>

<p>“Comprehend what?” she said.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?” he asked. “Will
you promise me not to be angry, and will
you keep your promise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Yes, tell me; I promise,” she said.
“I don’t believe I could fail to comprehend
whatever it is that you have to say
to me.”</p>

<p>“Then what I have to say is this—what
my heart burns to say, what I have
had to fight myself, day and night, since
the first day of your coming, to keep from
saying, is this—that I love you, and that
all my hope of joy is to have you for my
wife.”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and looked at
him with wonder and mystification in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said; “you were mistaken.
You cannot comprehend how I love you
so, when, as you think, I know you so
little. But there you are wrong. I know
you, as no one else in all the world can
possibly know you; and I think you, of
all the world, are the one who best knows
me. Here, look at this, and tell me if you
have ever seen it before.”</p>

<p>He took a packet from the drawer at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
his side, and put it in her hands. The
color flew to her face, and her lips parted
in a radiant smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I have seen it before.
Was this story written by you?”</p>

<p>“It was,” he answered; “and it is because
I know that you have read it and
have understood that it is no story, but
the baring of a man’s inmost heart, that I
say you know me as no one else does.
In the same manner also, it has come to
pass that I know you.”</p>

<p>“You got my manuscript?” she said.
“It was you to whom Mr. Black sent it
by mistake?”</p>

<p>“It was,” he answered; “and perhaps
it will not seem strange to you now when
I say, we are not strangers, but are intimately,
closely, mysteriously known to
one another. This knowledge of you, on
my part, has led to love—the first real
passion of my life. I loved you from the
hour that I read that paper. I loved your
nature, your mind, your soul. Now that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
I have seen you, in all your goodness and
loveliness and beauty, I love you beyond
all my dreams of love. And you?” he
said; “how is it with you, Ethel?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a slow, half-puzzled,
wholly confiding, and happy
smile.</p>

<p>“If you had asked me to marry you
without telling me this,” she said, “I
could not have said ‘yes.’ I might not
have told you the reason, but it would
have been that my heart was already given
to a man whom I had never seen, and
who was known to me only as ‘Hugh
Robertson.’”</p>

<p>“But now,” he said, “now that you
know that Hugh Robertson is really
Arthur Hugh Hubert, what will you say?
O Ethel, I love you with the hoarded
love of many loveless and lonely years!
Will you come to me, and be my wife?”</p>

<p>His eyes were glowing. His face was
flushed; his breathing came from him in
quick breaths. He did not move toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
her, but stood where he was, and held out
his arms.</p>

<p>And Ethel came to them, and as she
rested there an instant, and then turned
her face upward to receive his kiss, they
both felt in that moment’s ecstasy the
long thirsting of their souls satisfied at
last, completely and eternally, by the
divine draught of love.</p>

<p>After debating the matter for ten years
or so, John Hertford had made up his
mind to adopt St. Petersburg as a place of
residence, and was now on his way back to
New York, to order his affairs to that end.
He was not rich, but then he was not extravagant,
and his moderate income was
more than sufficient for the wants of a
man who had no one dependent on him,
and who had entirely made up his mind
not to marry. He had been in love more
than once in his life, and yet, ardent as his
feelings had been for the objects who
aroused that emotion in him, he had never
had quite the feeling to make him long to
call any woman his wife. The truth was
owned to himself in his secret heart—that
word “wife” possessed for him a significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
which involved so much that he had
often wondered, in early youth, if he could
ever actually find, in one personality, all
the qualities of mind and heart and person
which he looked for. In maturer years, he
had quite satisfied himself that the idea was
absurd. So he abandoned his youthful
dreams, without any great ado, especially
as he had found that life had certain positive
compensations for their loss. He made
up his mind, however, that he could not
accept less than his ideal in marriage, and
so, with more or less contentment, he had
shaped his life to the demands and dimensions
of a bachelor existence, and was
looking forward with pleasure to the more
deliberate and satisfactory settlement of
himself and his belongings at the brilliant
capital on his return. He was not indolent,
and his taste for art, music and
literature gave him plenty of occupation to
diversify the life of social pleasure in the
midst of which he had cast his lines.
He was a very popular man, and yet one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
could hardly tell exactly why it was that
men and women, and even children, liked
him so. His face was strong and interesting
rather than handsome, and his figure
active and powerful rather than elegant.
He had no especial charms of manner,
except a supremely winning trait of gentleness,
which would have made the eternal
happiness of his wife—had there been
such a being!</p>

<p>He was not looking forward with much
pleasure to his visit to his native country,
and had bound himself by the severest
obligations to be back in a very short
time; and now, on the first day out on his
ocean voyage, he found himself wishing
that the trip to New York was over, and
that he was going back. There would be
so many changes among his old friends—so
many reminders of the painful fact that
youth was passing—a thing he could
ignore much better in Russia than in his
own land!</p>

<p>He was, like many people whose attachments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
are warm when made, rather averse
to making new acquaintances, from the
fact that the ones already possessed kept
his faculty of affection sufficiently employed.
So, when he glanced over the
passenger-list, it was rather satisfactory
than otherwise to see there was no name
he knew. He had plenty of books with
him, and expected to find his time sufficiently
occupied in reading, and in escaping
from the bores by whom men crossing the
ocean are apt to be beset.</p>

<p>It was early in December, and the
weather was raw and cold. Hertford was
well protected against it, however, and
spent much of his time on deck. On the
afternoon of the second day out, he had
been comfortably settled for some time,
absorbed in his book, when, amid the confused
sounds of water and machinery and
human speech, he heard some words
spoken so near him that they compelled
the recognition of his consciousness.</p>

<p>“It seems that’s her aunt, and not her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
mother,” the voice said: and glancing up,
Hertford saw two women, who had placed
themselves very near him and were evidently
discussing some third party of travellers.
“I heard the beautiful girl call
her ‘Auntie,’ as I passed. I call the old
one the ‘Rich Lady,’ until I can find
out her name, because she’s so high and
mighty and magnificent. They’ve got a
foreign maid and man-servant with them,
and more furs and rugs and foot-warmers
and luxuries than any one on the ship. I
want you to watch the Rich Lady when
she speaks to those servants. I’ve heard
her call them both by name, and they had
foreign names unfamiliar to me; but I
told someone yesterday evening that, as
well as I could make out, she called the
maid ‘Minion,’ and the man ‘Varlet’—perhaps
her manner helped me a little to
this understanding of her words.”</p>

<p>The speaker and her companion both
laughed, and Hertford, amused, too, followed
the direction of their eyes, and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
identified the two persons under discussion.
It was certainly true that they were surrounded
by a greater evidence of magnificence
in their travelling paraphernalia than
any one else he had seen. Their deck-chairs,
cushions, rugs, and superb furs made them
seem almost unnecessarily luxurious. The
older of the two had her large and bony
frame stretched out at length on her deck-chair,
and her harsh profile, with its thin,
aquiline nose and thick, whitish eyebrows
was thrown out in high relief against the
dark-red cloak worn by her companion,
whose head was enveloped in its pointed
hood. The girl’s face was turned seaward,
so that Hertford could not get a
glimpse of it. But just as he had seen, in
spite of heavy coverings, that the older
woman’s figure was angular and thin, so
he could see, in the younger one’s, suggestions
of youthful vigor and loveliness. He
was conscious of being interested by the
mere pose of her head and turn of her
throat. Her red cloak was gathered in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the neck by an infinite number of fine,
flat little plaits that broke into free and
graceful folds about her shoulders, and
covered her arms and hands. Hertford
had given no more than a passing glance
to the faces of the two women whose
conversation he had overheard, and a
glance was enough to satisfy him also as
to the appearance of the girl’s companion; but
for several moments he kept his eyes
furtively upon the muffled figure and head
of the girl herself. As he was looking, a
more violent lurch than any that had preceded
it tipped the vessel so far on its
side that a great wave, which was advancing,
broke over the deck and deluged
everyone with the heavy salt water. In
an instant it had receded, leaving the floor
of the deck a running stream, and the
water standing in little puddles on rugs
and cloaks, and wherever it had found a
hollow to fill. Most of the passengers
laughed good-humoredly, and took it as a
joke, while the deck-stewards were brushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
them off and mopping up the water.
Hertford sat up and shook himself with a
smile, and as he did so, he heard his nearest
neighbor say:</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>do</i> look at the Rich Lady!”</p>

<p>She had drawn herself upward in her
chair, the picture of angry protest, and as
the assiduous steward hurried to her assistance, she
said, indignantly:</p>

<p>“Well! Are we likely to have much
more of this?” Quite as if she had put
up with as much from the ocean as she
proposed to stand!</p>

<p>As the humor of the thing flashed upon
Hertford, he glanced at the figure beyond,
which had also taken an upright position,
and he saw the very loveliest girl-face
that he had ever set his eyes on. He not
only saw it, but he exchanged with it a
glance of sympathetic amusement, which,
somehow, seemed to do the work of an
acquaintanceship of weeks. If, as George
Eliot so profoundly says, “A difference of
taste in jokes is a great strain on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
affections,” the reverse is equally true; and
a sense of liking sprang into being in
both of the individuals whose eyes met in
that momentary smiling glance. In an
instant they looked away from each other.
And now the two foreign servants came
hurrying up with towels and brushes.
Hertford could not distinctly make out the
hurried French sentences which the old
lady addressed to them, but he soon comprehended
the attitude which had suggested
the names of “Minion” and “Varlet”
to his bright little neighbor.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that it was the Rich
Lady’s will to go below, and she got to
her feet, shaking herself free from her
furs, and motioning her niece to follow
her. The girl rose obediently, and as
the maid came to her assistance, Hertford
noticed the gentle and amiable way
in which she spoke to the servant, in
strong contrast to the manner of the
older woman. She, however, responded
very submissively to her aunt’s wish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
although he thought it possible that she
would have preferred to stay. As she
passed very near to Hertford she did not
look toward him, and so he could venture
to look at her. Her profile was exquisite,
and her very manner of walking and holding
her wraps was full of charm for him.
When she was almost out of sight, he
obeyed the strong impulse which prompted
him to follow, and, leaving all his belongings,
he did so, keeping them in sight
until they had disappeared into one of the
<i>cabines-de-luxe</i>, the number of which he
easily ascertained. Then he went to the
saloon, where he looked at the passenger-list.
The names opposite the number of
that state-room were: <i>Mrs. Etheridge and
Miss Sheldon; valet et femme-de-chambre</i>.</p>

<p>He returned to his seat on deck, but
his book had lost its interest. There was
something in the glance of that girl’s eyes
which was enthralling. It crowded everything
else out of his mind. He sat there
thinking for a long time; and he felt it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
a real satisfaction when, at last, from
some deep recess of his memory he recalled
a rhyme which represented to him
exactly his present state of mind. He
said it to himself, under his breath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“But if Maud were all that she seemed,</div>
<div class="verse">And her smile had all that I dreamed,</div>
<div class="verse">Then the world were not so bitter</div>
<div class="verse">But a smile could make it sweet.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the days that followed, Hertford became
more completely absorbed in watching
this young girl, and wondering and
imagining about her, than he had ever
been in anything in his life. He never
saw her except at a distance, and even
then he guarded his looks carefully. The
two ladies seemed to have no acquaintances
on board, and if they had had, it
would have done him no good, for he
knew no one to introduce him. Besides,
he was not sure he wanted to be introduced.
There was more room for the
indulgence of dreams as things were now.</p>

<p>And he did indulge himself in dreams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
without restriction. The more he saw
of the beautiful young creature, the more
adorable she seemed to him. He never
met her suddenly, or even caught sight of
her red cloak at a distance, that he did
not feel a sudden stilling of his heartbeats,
followed by thick throbbings that
made his next few breaths difficult. Sometimes
he would meet her taking exercise
on the deck with her aunt, and sometimes
she was on the arm of a French
maid. Hertford noticed that when the
latter was her companion she had generally
a gayer and freer air, and he could
see that there were the kindest feelings of
sympathy and good-will between the two,
in spite of their different spheres of life.
The woman did not look as if she could
have answered to the name of “Minion,”
in this companionship! When, however,
the young girl was with her aunt, Hertford
often saw a look of constraint, and
even sadness, on her face. This set him
to conjecturing, and gave him a fear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
she might be dependent upon this rich
and exacting relative, and perhaps a victim
to her tyrannies and caprices. The mere
suggestion of it stirred in his heart depths
of tenderness whose very existence was a
surprise to him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, during the last days of
the voyage, Hertford had been sitting a
long time silently thinking. His thoughts
were always on one subject now—the
girl who, at this moment, sat in one of the
long row of chairs, made fast against the
rolling of the vessel. There were, perhaps,
half a dozen people between them,
but, although he had not looked toward
her since he sat down, he had no consciousness
of any human existence about
him but hers. He felt, moreover, in his
inmost soul, that she had a consciousness
of him. He was sure that an electric
current of sympathy communicated from
his heart to hers. There was nothing
whatever external to encourage him in his
belief—not a look nor a sign, but it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
a thing stronger than either. And whenever
he did meet her eyes, which was
rarely, what was it that gave him that inevitable
little shock, if it were not a meeting
of such currents? Of course, his
might be the positive and hers the negative,
but he absolutely believed she felt it, too.</p>

<p>As he sat there, watching the cold
flutter of the dingy white canvas that
covered the life-boat, made fast in front
of him, and which was shaken into strong
ripples by the winter wind, making a
crackling little noise, he liked to think
that they both saw and heard the same
things, and he longed to ask her if the
ridiculous little cannon, with its canvas
cover, did not remind her of a child on all
fours, under a table-cloth, playing <i>bogy</i>.
Why couldn’t he have a little innocent
talk with her? The restrictions imposed
by society seemed to him most absurd.</p>

<p>He became aware that the people between
him and the object of his thoughts
were, one by one, going away. At last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
a man and a woman sitting next to him got
up and went below, and now, with a
quickening of the heart, he realised that
the being nearest him, across that row of
empty chairs, was the girl whose image
had now out-crowded every other from
his heart. The maid was on the other
side of her, but they were both quite
silent. Presently he ventured to turn his
head and look toward her. Only her pure
profile was in view, but he felt that she
saw with her averted eyes that he was
looking at her. Her rounded cheek
seemed to return his gaze, and he was
almost certain that it reddened.</p>

<p>Of course, he might be mistaken in
thinking that she had any consciousness of
his existence. He had no real evidence of
the fact, but the unreal was enough for
him. He was always frank, in dealing
with himself, though often the reverse of
it, in interpreting himself to others. For
instance, he had always carefully concealed
the fact that he was, by nature, sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and romantic; but he knew it of
himself absolutely. He was not at all
surprised to find himself, now, in love with
a woman to whom he had never spoken.
It had always belonged to his old ideal of
himself that he should love at first sight,
if he ever loved at all, in the real sense.
This girl—if her nature and character
corresponded to her personality—was absolutely
all that he ever dreamed of; and
he had not a fear that, in knowing her,
he should find himself disappointed. Indeed,
what he felt was, that he absolutely
knew her already. It gave him a slight
twinge of regret to think she must be so
many years younger than himself—it
must be ten or twelve, for she could not be
over twenty-two or twenty-three. But
then she was a being with whom he might
renew his youth—indeed, she had already
called into fiery life all the most ardent
impulses of his earliest manhood. He had
made up his mind now that he would
make it his first business, on landing, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
get himself formally introduced to her.
He had satisfied himself, by marks on their
luggage, that their destination was New
York, so he knew he was not in danger
of losing sight of them. They were sure
to belong to his own world, and he knew
he could easily make their acquaintance.
As he sat there, so near her that by a
slight turn of the head he could see her,
he felt impatient at the formalities and
delays which must be gone through with,
before he could go to her boldly and ask
her to leave the irksome thraldom of her
life with her rich, old aunt, and be his
wife. That was exactly what he had to
say to her, with as little circumlocution
and delay as possible. His mind had
never been more definitely made up about
anything in his life. It was decidedly
pleasing to him to think of her as poor,
even though she had the surroundings of
riches and luxury. Still, how different to
be in the really independent position in
which he could place her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>A little thing had happened one day
during the voyage, that had touched and
pleased him intensely. A poor man had
died in the steerage, and a subscription
paper was sent around to raise money
for his family. When Hertford took
it, he ran his eye rather eagerly down
the column of names and figures and saw:
“Mrs. Etheridge, $100.00,” and under it,
“Miss Shelton, $1.00.” It went to his
heart that she had had so little to give,
but had not on that account refrained
from giving what she could. “Shelton,”
he kept saying over and over to himself,
trying in vain to remember if he had
ever known any one of the name. He
knew the name of Etheridge as belonging
to a rich and influential family in New
York, but could recall no definite acquaintance
even with them.</p>

<p>There was a lovely winter sunset that
evening, and Hertford felt it a delight that
his eyes took in the same scene as hers,
and felt that the same emotions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
aroused by it in both their hearts. When, at
last, she spoke to the maid and rose to go
below, he boldly resolved to make a move
at the same time, and so he walked the
length of the deck behind her, and followed
her through the door. It was a
delight to him even to catch the tones of
her voice as she spoke to the maid. As
they turned away in opposite directions,
their looks just met. How was it possible,
he asked himself, that he could feel what
he did from the touch of her eyes, and
she feel nothing? He did not believe it!</p>

<p>The next day they landed at New York,
and he saw her met by friends whose ardent
feeling showed how lovingly welcome she
was. They whisked her away in a handsome
carriage whose liveried servants, as
Hertford observed, showed far more pleasure
in their faces at welcoming the
young lady, than her august and stately
aunt.</p>

<p>Hertford was accorded a cordial welcome
by his old friends, and the first thing he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
found himself called upon to do was to
attend a large ball. He felt disinclined for
it, but the possibility of seeing the lovely
face that haunted every sleeping and waking
minute made him consent. One of
his former circle of friends insisted on
taking him, and as they drove through the
streets, he confided to Hertford the fact
that he was in love, and that he expected
to see at this ball the object of his affection,
who, it appeared, was a rich and
charming widow. The former of these
attributes was intimated very delicately,
but the whole thing seemed to Hertford,
in his present romantic state of mind, revoltingly
vulgar. How impossible it would
be to confide to his companion the feeling
that possessed his heart! Any allusion to
the money struck him as being unpardonable—and
he simply could not understand
a man’s finding it possible to be in love with
a widow. He thought of the lovely
maiden on whom his heart was fixed, and
the mere memory of her fresh young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
beauty made his pulses quicken. But he
forced himself to appear interested, and
wished his companion all success and happiness.</p>

<p>“The success would certainly secure
the happiness,” was the answer, “but the
trouble is there are a dozen fellows, besides
me, trying to marry her, and she declares
she will marry no one.”</p>

<p>As they got out of the carriage Hertford
dismissed the subject from his mind. He
had not yet got himself up to the point of
making definite inquiries about the lady of
his love, and it seemed to him now impossible
even to make a confidant of a man
whose nature could permit him to talk
about being in love with a rich widow!</p>

<p>As the two men walked about the rooms
together, each was conscious of being on
the watch, but Hertford, for his part, gave
no sign. He met a few old acquaintances
who remembered him still, but the place
was very barren and irksome to him, in
spite of its magnificent display, when suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
his companion gave his arm a jerk
and said: “There she is!”</p>

<p>But Hertford, too, had caught sight of
something that made his heart thump suffocatingly.
A few paces from him was a
tall, imposing, angular figure with a familiar
Roman profile, and at her side was the
adorable being he had so worshippingly
enshrined in his heart, looking so beautiful
in her white ball-dress that his eyes were
dazzled with the delight of this vision.
Again, as her eyes met his, he felt that
their spirits had touched. Out of the
delicious confusion caused by that glance,
he was roused by the consciousness that
he was being formally introduced.</p>

<p>“My friend Mr. Hertford, Miss Shelton—and
Mrs. Etheridge.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the former name, the
tall and sharp-faced lady made him a gracious,
if angular, acknowledgment; at
the mention of the latter, the beautiful
young creature in white looked up into
his face and gave him a frank and lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
smile. She seemed even to half-extend
her hand, and was beginning to speak,
when Hertford, bewildered, stunned, and
only dimly conscious of what he was
doing, made a hurried bow, and with some
excuse, moved rapidly away.</p>

<p>With a numbed consciousness, and a
bewilderment that scarcely allowed him to
realize the objects before his eyes, he somehow
got through the rooms and out into
the street, and, finally, into his own room
at the hotel. There he locked himself
in, and, without turning up the light, threw
himself upon his face on the bed. After ten
minutes of such fierce unhappiness as he
had never known before, he got up, turned
on the light, and looked at his dishevelled
figure in the glass. “Have I been crying?”
he said to himself, seeing that his
cheeks were flushed, his eyes red, and his
face dampened either by tears, or by the
sweat of pain. With his nature, romantic,
sensitive, the blow was a terrible one.</p>

<p>He sat down in a chair, thrust his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
fingers into his short locks, and rested his
elbows on his knees. With the feeling in
him that he could not give up this woman,
even for this, he began to struggle with
his disappointment. At first, it seemed
intolerable that she had once belonged to
another man—and he had to adjust his
whole being to these changed conditions.
He realized far more deeply than ever, how
he had fixed his very soul upon her, and
he resolved to go on and win her, if he
could. He forced himself to realize the fact
that she had loved another man, and had
suffered for his sake the pangs of widowhood.
It was some consolation to him to
see that she had outlived them, and he was
glad that youth and nature had asserted
themselves and enabled her to regain her
interest in life. No, he could not give
her up, without her own refusal to be his
wife. The fact that she had money, too,
was intensely unpleasant to him. It was
she—Mrs. Etheridge—who had given
the hundred dollars to the poor man, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
her arrogant-looking aunt, Miss Shelton,
who had given the one dollar! The
money was the girl’s, then—and she was
the “Rich Lady,” after all! He could
not get used to the idea.</p>

<p>But he had fought out the fight and
choked down his disappointment, by the
time the ball broke up, and Tom Kennedy,
puzzled by his friend’s strange conduct,
came in search of him.</p>

<p>When Hertford, in his disordered
evening-dress, admitted him in answer to
his knock, he was able to make up some
excuse about having felt a sudden vertigo
in the heated room, etc., and to carry it
off with some likeness to truth.</p>

<p>“By Jove! I don’t believe she half
liked your leaving—the lovely widow, I
mean! (There’s but one <i>she</i> to me now!)
And it seems you had crossed on the
steamer together without being acquainted!
It’s a wonder she even noticed you—but
she did—and she asked three or four
times where you were gone. I begin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
be reconciled to your going back so soon,
old man. She takes more interest in you
than I exactly fancy.”</p>

<p>Hertford let him run on with this flippant
sort of talk, for the sake of the information
he let drop now and then. He
discovered that the haughty individual who
acted as her chaperon was in reality a poor
relation, dependent on her bounty; though,
as Kennedy said, she owed everything to
this aunt, who had made this rich match
for her, and had married her to a husband
who died in a year, leaving her a millionaire.
This made Hertford wince with
pain. The whole interview was frightfully
trying, and he was relieved to be
alone at last.</p>

<p>He passed a sleepless night, and a restless,
impatient morning. In the afternoon
he inquired his way to Mrs. Etheridge’s
house, and rang the bell, sending in his
card for the two ladies. Miss Shelton, it
turned out, was not at home, but after a
few minutes spent in a magnificent drawing-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
down the long vista of which
he could see into other superb apartments
beyond, the young widow came to him.</p>

<p>Hertford was so entirely sure that they
understood each other, that it was all he
could do to keep from asking her, then
and there, to be his wife. The restrictions
of conventionality prevailed, however,
and they kept to mere friendly discussion
of the events of the voyage, and
such things. It was so free and delightful,
however, this long talk, that he stayed
on and on, and when he rose to go, and
she gave him her hand, he dared to hold
it a second longer than was necessary, and
to feel that the touch conveyed a message
to her heart. It is certain that she blushed,
as he looked down at her, and that the
blush made her a hundred times more bewitching
to his heart and senses than
before.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the grand hall that
he crossed in leaving her, and the suggestions
of great wealth that he saw on every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
side, grated upon him, but, as he walked
away from her presence, he was too blissfully
in love for that to matter much. He
felt perfectly certain, in spite of the odious
idea suggested by his friend’s coarse way
of putting things, that the marriage had
been a love-match; for it was absolutely impossible
that the divinely good, and sweet,
and modest creature from whom he had just
parted, ever could have married from any
motive but love. He even got up a sort
of emotion of pity for the dead man, when
he thought of what had been lost to him,
and yet he felt any dealing of fate to be
merciful, which opened to him the only
chance of supreme and ideal happiness,
which his life had ever offered.</p>

<p>He spent the next day with lawyers,
absorbed in business affairs. In the evening
he went to the theater, where he saw
the woman he loved surrounded by a gay
party. But she looked at him, as he passed,
with a look that thrilled to his heart’s
core, and all through the play he was happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
in the sense that she thought of him, and
even furtively watched him. Coming out,
he met Tom Kennedy, who walked along
the street with him, beginning at once to
speak of Mrs. Etheridge. Hertford, with
a certain reluctance, asked some question
about Mr. Etheridge. He felt jealous of
the man, and at the same time, sorry for
him. He inquired how long he had been
dead.</p>

<p>“O, three years, or such a matter.
She’s only just come back into the gay
world. No one can say she did not play
her part with propriety. It was even more
than could have been expected from a girl
of twenty, to go into such long retirement
for a husband four times her age.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Hertford, in a low, contained
voice, swerving a little in his gait,
but otherwise apparently calm.</p>

<p>“O, he must have been well on to eighty,
I should think,” replied the other, “though
his wretched old body was cosmetized and
bolstered up with the utmost care to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
the last. By the way—you saw him!
Don’t you remember our laughing at the
decrepit old dandy at the races that day
when Hotspur won?—the old fellow who
tried so hard to give a cheer, but couldn’t
get up the voice, and who incessantly
‘wrestled with his false teeth,’ as I remember
you put it? That was Etheridge.
Don’t you remember him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hertford, coldly, “I remember
him distinctly.”</p>

<p>A moment later, he had excused himself
and returned to his hotel.</p>

<p>The next day, and the day after,
he applied himself very closely to business,
and was so successful in getting
through with it, that he caught the same
steamer on its return trip, and started back
to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>He had been gone a month, perhaps,
when Mrs. Etheridge, who had been
little seen by her friends, either in society,
or at her own house, said abruptly one
day to Tom Kennedy, to whom she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
not been at home once since Hertford’s
departure:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hertford once lived in New
York—did he not?”</p>

<p>“O, yes—born and raised here,” was
the off-hand response.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said, facing him
unswervingly, though her cheeks reddened,
“do you know whether he ever saw my—I
mean Mr. Etheridge? Did he know
him?”</p>

<p>“No—he never knew him, I’m sure,
but he saw him once at the races. I was
reminding him of it the last evening I saw
him. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I merely wondered if they ever met,”
she answered, carelessly. “I never heard
my husband speak of him.” She said the
word out boldly this time.</p>

<p>“No—I fancy not,” said Kennedy.
“They were not friends at all. In fact,
Hertford had no idea he was the man you
had married, until I told him.”</p>

<p>Kennedy was a little dull, and he wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
now, why in the world she was interesting
herself in such a trivial matter.</p>

<p>He had joined Mrs. Etheridge on the
street, and he walked home with her. When
they reached her handsome residence, and
the doors were thrown open, she did not
ask him to come in, but said good-bye
rather abruptly. She crossed the magnificent
hall and walked with a firm step up
the grand staircase. Then, entering her
own splendid apartment, she locked herself
in and stood silent a few moments.
Then she spoke aloud, safe from being
heard in that lofty vastness.</p>

<p>“That was the man I could have
loved,” she said, “the man I do love!
And I might have married him!”</p>

<p>In a second, she added, in a tone grown
thick and indistinct with tears:</p>

<p>“And he loves me, too! I know he
does—or did, until he knew!”</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms, with her
hands clenched hard, and saw herself reflected
from every side in splendidly-framed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> 
mirrors, which gave back her
image, from head to feet, in her elegant
French costume. They showed her, too,
the innumerable beauties of her luxurious
rooms, hung with satin and carpeted with
velvet.</p>

<p>She gave a cry of horror, and shut out
the vision with her hands. Her birthright
was gone, and this was her mess of
pottage!</p>

</div>

<p>It was a beautiful country through
which the Aroona River ran; so beautiful
that at last, after ages of unmolested repose,
a railroad had been built along the
top of the mountain ridge, and tourists had
begun to talk of its attractions. As yet,
however, they knew the fertile little valley
only from a distance. The point most
admired by the passengers on those flying
trains, was that where the Aroona lay
beneath them, like a great tin funnel on
its side. They could see it, in one place,
broad and placid, and could follow distinctly
its sharp and sudden compression
into a passage forced between two great
walls of rock, where it seethed and rushed
through the contracted space representing
the stem of the funnel. This was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
The Narrows, and below it was The Falls—a
foaming cataract that dashed relentlessly
over great, dangerous-looking rocks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the passing tourists sometimes
wondered what sort of men and women
they were, who lived in the odd, misshapen
little houses, bunched together to form
the tiny village, which was not much more
than a dot on the landscape. It soon
passed out of sight, and they thought of it
no more, and yet it is likely that they
were more concerned about these obscure
country people, whose very isolation made
them interesting to speculative minds, than
the latter allowed themselves to be concerned
about the occupants of the trains,
which, twice a day, darted along the high
horizon line, almost as swift and mysterious
as meteors crossing the heavens.
They were tranquil-minded, unimaginative
people, and lived their lives and died their
deaths in this distant valley of the earth,
without much interest in what lay beyond.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of this village was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
house conspicuously superior to the rest.
It was built on a slight elevation of
land, and had some claim to ornament and
architectural display. It was also supplied
with comfortable outhouses and enclosed
grounds.</p>

<p>Back of this house, beyond the commodious
barn, was a little well-worn pathway,
which led through the large vegetable-garden
down to what had once been an old
dairy and spring-house. The spring was
long since dried up, and the building would
perhaps have fallen into disuse, had it not
been that someone had taken possession
of it and put it to a decidedly novel purpose.
Almost one-half of it was occupied by a
grand piano. Lying on top of this was a
violin-case carefully closed, a lot of loose
music, some bits of charcoal, some dilapidated
paint-tubes, a very dirty palette, and
other odds and ends of accumulated litter.</p>

<p>On the walls, and scattered all about in
various stages of incompleteness, were
sketches in oil, water-color, and charcoal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
all unmistakably bad, and yet with a quality
in them that indicated that the mind
had had something to express, in spite of
the impotency of the hands. The room
was dusty and disordered, and smelt
strongly of tobacco, but the windows were
open, and this odor was forced to give
place, now and then, to the fresh, keen
breath of the blooms of the honeysuckle
vines, which hung in green density over
the rickety porch without. There had
been a heavy rain, and the wet sweetness
was delicious.</p>

<p>The path through the old vegetable-garden
had been carefully cleared at the
important period known as “garden-making
time,” but now, in late summer, the
weeds and grass had so encroached upon
it as to make it almost as wet as the cabbage
and potato patches on each side.</p>

<p>Down this path, stepping very cautiously,
there came now a man and a child.
The former was tall, thin, and much bent
in figure. His hair and beard were scant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in quantity, and almost white. He had
deep lines in his face, such as could only
have been made there by age or sorrow.
His features were without beauty, and
quite unremarkable, except the eyes, which
had a look that caught and fixed the attention.
That look, one of earnest beseeching,
was turned now upon the child, whose
little hand was clasped in his great bony
one, and who kept up with his shuffling
stride by a little skipping motion, which
bobbed her bright head up and down and
seemed directly connected with the inarticulate
murmurs which came from her
lips, expressive of a totally irrelevant and
irresponsible joyousness. Her little calico
frock was neatly made, well-fitting and
clean, while the clothing of the man
looked, by contrast, almost piteously
shabby and uncouth. His hair, too, was
long, and straggled over his ears, meeting
and mixing with his beard in confused disorder.
The child was captivatingly pretty.
Her nose was a queer little pug, her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
were enormously big and round. Her flesh
was deliciously smooth, and her hair was
curly gold, that, freely exposed to the sunlight,
gave back shining for shining. She
was not more than four or five years old,
plump and chubby in figure, and seemed
to give out an exuberant happiness, brighter
than birds or butterflies.</p>

<p>As the path got lower down the hillside,
the dampness of the undergrowth increased,
so that the child’s feet were in danger of
getting wet. Noticing this fact, the man
stooped and lifted her in his arms. Even
this did not stop the sort of physical bubbling-over,
which she had been keeping up,
and she still dipped and nodded from her
perch, and uttered her little gleeful gurgles,
as if her heart had more joy than it could
silently contain.</p>

<p>When they reached the gloomy little
house, the man was very careful to close
the door behind him, and his next action
was to draw before the window the muslin
curtains, which had once been white, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
were now dust-stained and weather-beaten.
Then, with the air of old habit, he placed
the child among the tumbled cushions of
the sofa, saying, as he carefully felt first
one foot, and then the other:</p>

<p>“Rose-Jewel mustn’t get her feet wet.
Mamma wouldn’t like that. No, they’re
all right. And, now, must I tell you a
story?”</p>

<p>The child shook her head in decided rejection
of this idea, and said in an imperious
voice:</p>

<p>“No, play.”</p>

<p>He did not speak at once, but reached
up and took the shapeless old hat from his
head, and, with a sudden jerk, shook backward
the thin locks which straggled over
his forehead. There was unmistakable
gratification in his face, as of one who had
received a welcome invitation for which
he had been too humble to look.</p>

<p>One would have thought it likely that
the child, when she spoke, would call
him “Grandpapa,” but she turned her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
insistent gaze upon him now and said peremptorily:</p>

<p>“Play, Papa, play!”</p>

<p>As he crossed over to where his violin-case
lay, there had come a sudden buoyancy
into his figure, and as he lifted the
instrument carefully from its case and began
to tune it, his face, too, was fervid and
alert. The fact became evident now, that
he was not an old man. There was all
the strength of youth in the sudden motion
with which he braced his shoulder to the
violin, and all the fire of youth was in his
eyes.</p>

<p>The child looked upward into his face,
and smiled. He returned the smile, and
with a bright nod of encouragement and
promise, he broke into the gay movement
of a little dance tune, played with extraordinary
brilliancy of execution.</p>

<p>“How’s that, baby? Here we go! Now
the pretty lady is going down the line and
holding up her pink silk dress. Listen to
that! And now they are all catching hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
and whirling round and round, and everybody
is laughing—and here goes the music
like this!”</p>

<p>As he fiddled away at the merry tune,
bending about, and jerking his head and
elbows, the child got into a state of ecstatic
glee, clapped her hands and laughed aloud,
and finally slipped off the sofa, caught up
her skirts, and began to dance. It was
done with the tottering, uneven motion of
a baby, but there was extraordinary vim in
it, and as the music got every moment
gayer and faster, she jumped and whirled
about, until her companion, with a wild
laugh of delight threw down violin and bow,
and caught her up in his arms, covering
her with kisses, and jumping about, himself,
in rather a mad fashion, with the music
in his blood, as well as hers. Then growing
calmer he put her back upon her
cushions, and taking up his violin, said
soothingly:</p>

<p>“Now Rose-Jewel’s tired, and Papa’s
going to make her rested. Sit still, darling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
a little while, and see if you don’t
feel as if you were in a lovely little cradle
with soft blue ribbons on it, and a little
bird singing on the window sill. Now
listen for the little bird.”</p>

<p>He drew the bow across the strings
once, twice, with long minor tones, and
then he began the bit of descriptive improvising.
The child sank back in the cushions,
and breathed a long sigh of ease.
When the motion of the cradle was indicated,
she rocked her little body slightly,
from side to side, and closed her eyes luxuriously.
Then, with his gaze fixed on her
face, and with an intensity of fervid feeling
that made him almost beautiful, the musician
touched some short staccato notes
that made a little cheeping sound, to which
the child delightedly responded by saying:</p>

<p>“Birdie! Birdie! Birdie!” and made
an infantine effort to snap her plump fingers.</p>

<p>The man’s face grew radiant. Holding
aside the violin in one hand and the bow in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the other, he took a few steps toward her,
bent down, and kissed first one, and then
the other of the soles of her little shoes,
which were covered with fine grains of
damp sand, that he felt against his lips.</p>

<p>“The good God gave you to me, Rose-Jewel,”
he said. “Put your hands together
while I play Him a prayer of
thanks.”</p>

<p>Unquestioningly, the child placed her
two hands palm to palm, and looked up
reverently, as he began to play.</p>

<p>It was a strange, wild, sweet <i>Te Deum</i>
that rose now and filled the little room.
The very heart of praise was in it, the very
soul of thankfulness. The man’s dark
eyes, for the time, had lost sight of the gift
in the Giver, and were turned upward to
the dingy ceiling, that was soon obscured
by tears. The large drops rolled from his
lids and ran down his cheeks. His face
grew strained and seamed with agitation,
and a thick sob rose in his throat. Still
he played on with that rapt, uplifted gaze,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
until a sound from the sofa recalled him,
and he started, and lowered his bow-arm
with a sudden movement of dismay.</p>

<p>There were tears in the eyes of Rose-Jewel,
too, and her little heart, which he
felt should know only the joy of praise,
was tasting too soon its sorrow and solemnity.
As one quick, sharp sob followed
another he felt a sudden deep contrition
stab him, and lifting his bow again, he began
to play in a quieting, comforting, reassuring
strain, interspersed with words
that matched it.</p>

<p>“The dear God loves us both, Rose-Jewel,”
he said. “He wants us to be
happy and bright, and not cry or get frightened.
He sends us beautiful angels to
take care of us, and make us go to sleep,
and have sweet dreams. Listen to this
now, and see if you don’t hear them flying
into the room.”</p>

<p>The child ceased sobbing, and listened
with earnest attentiveness, and by and by
he had the joy of seeing her fall into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
gentle sleep. He played on, pleasing himself
with the idea that his music represented
to her, in her sleep, the dreams the
angels brought.</p>

<p>At last, when she had sunk into a slumber
too deep for dreams, and even the sobbing
breaths of her scarcely spent emotion
were stilled, he gently laid by his violin
and came and sat down beside her. He
placed himself, with extreme care not to
disturb her, at the bottom of the sofa upon
which she lay. His eyes lingered on her
a moment, and then wandered around the
room. The poor sketches on the walls,
all so weak and ineffectual, looked back at
him sadly, as it seemed to him, and the
piano was another reproach.</p>

<p>This man—Hugh Eastin—had once
thought that he would be a great musician,
and many years of hard study had made
him rather a distinguished one, within a
limited field; but nothing had come of it.
At the end of that time, in the impulsive
way in which he did things, he had married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
and of that marriage he was the victim.
He did not say so to himself; perhaps he
did not even know it; but the paralysis
which had fastened on his mind and soul
was directly the result of his marriage.
It would hardly have been possible for him
to realize this, as he had enthusiastically
agreed with all his friends that he was an
extraordinarily fortunate man to win for a
wife the pretty, virtuous, healthy, good-tempered
young girl, who was known to be
the heiress of the neighborhood from which
she came. Her father had manifested the
ambition he had for his only child, by sending
her off to the city to be educated, and
she had not graduated at school before the
young musician, who gave lessons to the
advanced pupils, had seen and fallen in love
with her, and had obtained her consent, as
well at that of her father, to their marriage.
The engagement might have been sufficiently
long to give them an opportunity
to discover their unfitness for each other,
had it not been that the girl’s father died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
very suddenly. It was then decided that,
as she had no near relations to be responsible
for her, she should be married at once.
The wedding was therefore hastened, and
he found himself, almost before he could
realize the change in the current of his
life, settled at the obscure country place,
which his wife resolutely determined never
to leave, and all his dreams of foreign
study, and achievement in his art were suddenly
in ashes.</p>

<p>It took him many a day to realize the
inevitableness of his present environment,
and when at last he looked it in the face,
it bewildered him. He was married to a
woman as severely practical in her ideas,
and systematic in her life, as he was visionary
and erratic. She was stronger than
he, both in nature and character, and
the habit of yielding to her had now
become the absolute rule of his life.
Very shortly after their marriage she had
found his music an inconvenience, and
although she had made no outward objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
to the arrival of the grand piano, she
had, when it suited her, accomplished its
removal to the old outhouse, where no one
could be disturbed by it. It was not so
much the noise she minded, as the sight of
useless hours and misdirected energies.
On coming into her property she had
shown herself a capable business woman,
and she managed the large farming operations
in connection with it with ability and
success. It had never seemed to occur to
her to commit these matters to her husband,
and he felt it a deep relief that he
was spared an effort which he knew would
have ended in failure. Early in their
married life he had suspected that his wife
felt her marriage to have been a foolish
one, and as time went on the certainty
of this conviction settled upon him. But
then came the children, and in them, without
doubt, she was more than compensated
for her disappointment in her husband.</p>

<p>She was a woman of great shrewdness,
and her decision that her husband had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
capacity in him but music, once made, she
ceased to expect anything but music from
him. For herself, she had no respect for
music as an art, and no perception of it as
an enjoyment, and she did not scruple to
say so. One day her husband heard her
say to a friend, that she prayed every
morning and evening of her life that she
might never have a musical child. He
never forgot that moment. It was not
said to him, but she evidently had no objection
to his hearing it. It was only an
incidental remark, and the two women
went on with the discussion of household
affairs, from which it had been an off-shoot.
As for Eastin, his heart-strings tightened,
his breath came quick, his throat hurt him,
and his eyeballs grew hot with the repression
of tears. A sick terror seemed to
take possession of him, and when he turned
and walked to the window, his eyes seemed
to look out on absolute despair.</p>

<p>For he, poor fellow, had been praying a
prayer, too—the one consistent, fervid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
passionately persevered in prayer of his
life. Night, and morning, and at noonday,
whether on his knees or walking in the
fields or wandering along the river banks,
or oftener still, when he held his precious
violin beneath his chin, that prayer arose
with suddenly uplifted eyes to the great
God whose power was infinite, and who
could, if He would, give him his heart’s
desire—a child with the musical gift. He
longed, too, that this child might have a nature
and heart to comprehend and sympathize
with his, though his wish he did not
put into words. He felt absolutely sure
that the greater would contain the less, and
that if the music were there the sympathy
could not lack. He knew his wife was
right in holding that the musical faculty,
alone, was a blessing to no one, and his
hope was that this child might inherit from
its mother the decision, industry and capableness
that would complement the gift
of music, which was the one thing of himself
that he felt he could wish any child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
of his to possess. He was acutely aware
that his life was a failure—that he had
lacked the capacity to put his musical power
to any use. He had worked hard over it
for years, and although people had praised
and admired his music, no advancement or
recognition amounting to anything had
come of it. He knew that it was his own
fault—he claimed no sympathy for himself
and no merit. He wished that the child
might have all the traits that he lacked,
but he passionately wished, also, that it
might have one thing that he possessed—this
spirit of music, that was to him alternately
a devil of despair and an angel of
consolation. Surely, surely, if another
being should possess an inward prompting
such as his, something would come of it!
Surely, no other creature who possessed it
could be so handicapped by the impotent
body and incapable mind, which he knew
to be its accompaniment in him!</p>

<p>Dreams of that child were the theme
of all his aspirations and imaginations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and when, in the midst of some uplifting
strain of music, he realized that it was
absolutely a possibility—a thing that might
simply and naturally come about, he would
sometimes utter his soul in such sounds of
harmony, that again would come the old
haunting thought of composing some
grand oratorio or opera, and he would begin
desperately to try to get down on paper
the music in his soul.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fit of exaltation and
hope would last for hours, but it was
enough to be brought for one moment into
contact with the realities around him to
stop it all. A summons to dinner would
come, perhaps, and, if obeyed, the atmosphere
produced by this change of scene
was fatal. If he ventured to disregard
such a summons, he felt the pall of coldness
and disapproval hanging over him,
and that feeling crippled him. It was a
favorite remark of his wife, that considering
how little she required or expected
of him, she thought she had a right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
demand that he should be regular at meals,
and should not counteract the lesson of
punctuality which she tried to instil into
her children. He felt the force of this,
and stifled his complaints, living in dread
of meal-time, and often prevented by this
dread from making any progress at all.</p>

<p>When the heavy discouragement which
came from his continually frustrated efforts
settled down upon him, he grew moody
and silent, and feeling that he was a drone
in this busy household, he would seek the
wide and unreproaching fields, or sit by the
placid river bank, and content himself for
hours imagining what would happen if the
wonder-child he dreamed of should be
born to him. His own life and career
were utterly without hope, but now he
could live again a better, fuller, freer life
in this fresh young one, unhampered by
inherent difficulties and self-made hindrances.</p>

<p>As time went on his life became daily
more circumscribed and aimless. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
wife, with her usual shrewdness, had discovered
that any effort to make a farmer
and a man of business of him would be
folly, and had long ago given it up. By
degrees, she seemed to expect less and less
of him, accepted the evident and inevitable,
and ordered the life of her household in
complete independence of him. She was
a woman who felt it important to have
the approval of her conscience and her
neighbors, and both the one and the other
acquitted her of blame concerning her duty
as a wife. Sometimes people expressed
wonder at her great patience with such
a husband—a thing that she never encouraged
them to say—but she felt that she
deserved the tribute, and in this opinion
her husband concurred. The task in life
to which she set herself with the greatest
fervor was to counteract in her children
any tendency to resemble their father. So
far, there had been slight indication of
anything of the sort, and after having
borne four little counterparts of herself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
dispositions and tastes, she had almost
ceased to dread a reproduction of her
husband.</p>

<p>In the same way Eastin had almost
ceased to hope for that which she dreaded.
In four instances had he gone through that
agitating conjecture, and wonder, and hope,
and fear, and hung eagerly upon every
sign of baby intelligence that he saw.
He would make occasions for taking the
babies—the first, the second, the third,
the fourth, consecutively—apart from
every observer, and would hum or whistle
different tunes to them, play furtively on a
little music-box he had procured for the
purpose, and even—when he could keep
them long enough from their watchful
mother’s observation—try the effect of
playing to them on his piano or violin,
after having propped them safely on the
sofa where he could watch every expression
that crossed their little faces.</p>

<p>Few souls, the greatest and strongest, can
have known deeper pain than that endured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
by this starved and eager man, as the result
of all these experiments. If by any chance
an illusive look or smile led him to believe
that for which he so thirsted was at last
held to his lips, the disappointment which
followed was only the keener. Each one
of his children, boys and girls, had proved
to be almost mysteriously like their mother.
He used to wonder at this, and at times
some bitterness mingled with the wonder
in his gentle breast. Were they not his
children, too? Why was it that, as if by instinct,
each one of them would range itself
with their mother, while he stood perpetually
alone? The paternal instinct, at
first so profoundly stirred in him, grew
weak and meaningless, as the sure development
of time would place the child by
nature and instinct, and later by choice,
with his wife and her other children.</p>

<p>In every instance, the children, beginning
with indifference about music, grew
to dislike it, encouraged by their mother,
who always showed her approval when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
this feeling was manifested. It was simple
and explicable enough. The mother was
a strong, compelling, intensely alive personality,
whose importance and authority
everyone recognized, while the father was
gentle, deprecating and insignificant, and
it was not hard for the intuition of childhood
to discover that he was tolerated
rather than approved. There were even
occasions upon which they had heard him
laughed at and turned into amiable ridicule.</p>

<p>Once, in the presence of the older children,
some neighbors had come to make a
visit, one of the number being so unusually
experienced for that country as to have
lived for a winter in the city where Eastin
had met his wife. This woman, whose
face and voice had a certain quality of
sympathy which touched his heart, drew
Eastin into conversation—a thing which
scarcely any one ever took the trouble to
do. She remembered to have heard him
play at a concert with a very beautiful
young girl, who had been compelled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
illness to stop in the midst of her performance.
After reminding Eastin that she
had been present at this concert, the visitor
said suddenly:</p>

<p>“What became of that lovely girl who
was taken ill that night?”</p>

<p>“Dead, darling,” Eastin astonished her
by saying, throwing into his answer all
the plaintive tenderness aroused by the
reminiscence, and not noticing the fact
that he had applied a term of endearment
to the decorous matron before him. He
perhaps would never have realized it, if a
suppressed titter, in which his own children
took part, had not called his attention
to the fact. Then he recollected himself,
and a hot flush rose to his face. He got
up and left the room, not in the least
comforted by the fact, that, as he did so,
he heard his wife rebuking the children for
laughing at their father. It seemed to put
him in such a miserable position that the
rebuke should be necessary, and that his
wife, in giving it, manifested a degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
wifely dutifulness for which her friends
gave her their admiration.</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes as he took
up his old slouch hat from the hall table and
put it on, letting himself out into the sunlit
fields where the birds made their music
without calling contempt upon themselves,
and where nature seemed to hold out her
arms to him and to invite him to repose
upon the only breast which harbored no
disapproval or criticism of him.</p>

<p>One thing which had bitten deep into
Eastin’s heart was shame at the lack of
resolution and purpose, which had allowed
him all these years to go on with this idle
and aimless life. Once or twice he had
made an effort to escape it, but those had
been the occasions of the most painful and
bitter scenes he had ever known. His
idea of going forth into the world and
making a career for himself with his music
was the one thing his wife would not tolerate.
She was afraid of what this break
from his family might lead to, and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
all a country-bred woman’s horror of being
pointed at as a deserted wife. It mattered
little that her husband was separated from
her in soul, compared to what it would be
to have him separated from her visibly.
It was pride—pride for her wifehood and
motherhood—that made her feel so intensely
on this subject, and she made no
pretense of any more tender feeling.</p>

<p>If she had made it the appeal of love,
even at this late hour, and had shown him
that she wanted him to stay, because he
was dear to her, he would have stayed and
been happy. But his reason for staying was
that when she told him that it was the one
thing he could ever do for her or for her
children—that neither had anything besides
this to ask at his hands—her words, scathing
and mortifying as they were, carried
conviction, and he felt a moment’s divine
thrill in making the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Another motive which prompted him to
stay was a natural and unconquerable self-distrust,
which warned him unceasingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
that failure and disappointment were to be
his lot in life. There was still a third
motive—stronger, perhaps, than either of
the others, and the one of all the three
which he was most reluctant to own.
This was a feeling deep in his soul, that a
return to the conditions of life which he
had once known would put him to a terrible
test. His artistic temperament made
him keenly susceptible to appeals to the
senses, and during all these years his senses
had been so starved that he was actually
afraid to go willfully into places of temptation.
A life of that sort would be infinitely
more dangerous to him now than it had
been before, for the reason that in youth he
had always an ideal to live up to, and he
had no ideal now. He had then been constrained
to keep from self-abasement by
the thought of bringing a clean body and
soul to offer to the woman he would some
day love. But the clear star of ideal love
no longer shone for him, and the thought
of what he might do if opportunity came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
was a powerful restraint upon him. This,
with the two other strong reasons, was sufficient
to bind him to the spot of earth on
which his wife and children lived.</p>

<p>He was not without a real attachment to
his family, and he was proud of the two
healthy boys and the two rosy-faced girls in
a deprecating sort of way, which implied his
knowledge that he deserved the least possible
credit for them. But these were quiet,
serious feelings, which had more the nature
of opinions than emotions. He had been
acutely disappointed to find almost immediately
after his marriage that his wife was
in no sense a companion to him, and he
had since become convinced that any possibility
of a companionship with his children
was out of the question.</p>

<p>So all those prayers had been in vain!
There was pain intolerable in the thought,
but he did not cease to pray. His one hope
of getting his prayer was the intensity of its
earnestness. It was, therefore, a shock that
stunned his very soul to hear his wife say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
that she had been praying all the time that
what he asked might be withheld. What
more natural than that her prayers should
have been granted, and his denied? She
was a good and religious woman, who
never omitted going to church or any religious
duty. She was almost the support
of the minister, and was generous in her
gifts to missions and charities. He, poor
old musician and dreamer, rarely saw the
inside of a church, and when he did, he
felt, as he said himself, like a poor relation
admitted on sufferance. Often he played
prayers on his violin, which he felt upbore
his soul to God, and he sometimes
passionately felt that if God would give
him his heart’s desire he would make the
remainder of his life an act of praise and
thanks to Him.</p>

<p>When his fifth child was born—a girl—he
felt for the first time an apathetic
hopelessness about it. Since he had known
of his wife’s daily prayer, his own seemed
very useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>His wife felt more satisfaction than regret
in the fact that Eastin scarcely looked
at this baby, and never voluntarily held
nor, indeed, touched it. He had given evidence
of no feeling against the little creature,
and had shown himself, as ever,
gentle and tender of the mother’s weakness
and pain, but there was a difference
between his bearing toward this child and
the others. The mother wondered a little
why this was, but was far from suspecting
the truth.</p>

<p>He showed the same indifference when
the time came to choose a name for the
baby. Heretofore, he had interested himself
especially on this point. His wife
had allowed him to call one of the girls
“Adelina,” rather liking the name, but
had rebelled at “Wolfgang” and “Sebastian”
for the boys. In this instance,
being left quite free, she called the child
“Rose-Jewel,” the latter part being a
family name of her own. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
name was told to the father he gave it a
listless approval.</p>

<p>Eastin had aged within the past year.
The period marked by his wife’s avowal
to her friend had been the beginning of a
change in him. His figure became bent
and thin, his hair whitened, and he became
more than ever indifferent about his dress.
A dullness settled on him, also, that made
him a sombre figure in that active household.
Sometimes a consciousness of this
oppressed him, and at times he would wish
with a long sigh that life was over for him.</p>

<p>When Rose-Jewel was about a year old
he happened one day to be in the room
with her when she was taking her mid-day
nap. The mother and other four children
were out in the village. Walking
across the room, he had had no consciousness
of the baby’s presence until a pretty
little chuckling sound caused him to look
toward the crib. There he saw behind
the wooden railings a face that was exquisitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
sweet and merry, with cheeks
rosy from sleep, and towzled golden hair,
and a pair of beautiful great eyes that
looked at him with love.</p>

<p>He stopped short, and his heart gave an
excited leap. The child, of course, was
familiar with the sight of him and was absolutely
unafraid. He went a step nearer
and bent forward over the crib. As he
did so the baby smiled. It must be a hard
heart that refuses to return the smile of a
child, and Eastin’s heart was soft as wax
to any sign of love. The baby smiled
again, and this time the smile was accompanied
by a repetition of the little gurgling
laugh. Eastin’s face grew red, then pale,
and he fell upon his knees beside the crib.
A mighty impulse stirred his heart. It
gave a great bound, as if it freed itself from
cords that had held it in and from weights
that had dragged it down. Words that
leaped upward as if from its secret depths
came in rapid whispers from his lips.</p>

<p>“Almighty God,” he said, “great Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
of all the earth, whose power is supreme,
whose goodness to men is boundless, who
gives to the ungrateful and unworthy as
well as to the faithful and good! O great,
and powerful, and merciful, and kind, and
pitying God, give me in this child the desire
of my heart! Give her the power to
be what I have never been—the power
to feed the hungry souls of men and women
with the heavenly bread of music—the
power to brighten their dark souls with
its light—to ease their aching hearts with
its divine consolations—to drown their
restlessness in its peace! My God, my
God,” he pleaded, shaking back the straggling
locks of hair, as he had been used to
do when he became excited in playing, and
shutting fast his eyes, while his hands were
clasped on the railing of the crib with a
hard pressure that strained the muscles
into knobs, “the power is Thine—Thou
canst! Thou canst! I do believe—in
spite of all my faithlessness—I do believe!
I know that Thou hearest! I know this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
prayer of the poorest and most unworthy
of Thy creatures goes straight to Thy
infinite heart! O God, Thou hadst a
Son! Thou art the Father of the Lord
Jesus! In His name I ask! In the
name of Him who said that those who
came to Thee should in no wise be cast
out!”</p>

<p>All the time that he was uttering these
impassioned words the baby was looking
at him in serene contemplation. Her
little feet were bare, and she kicked them
about and caught them in her hands, and
wriggled her plump body from side to side,
while she watched the strange motions of
his head and eyes and lips as if it were an
amusement got up for her benefit. As
the last words were uttered, she laughed
again—a little laugh that ended in a high,
clear note that sent a thrill of ecstacy
throughout the man’s whole being. He
trembled visibly and his face grew pale
with the thick beating of his heart. For
a moment he was absolutely still. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
for one instant, he raised his eyes, which
were filled with tears, and his lips moved
meekly. Then he looked down again at
the child, bent his head over the crib, and
began to whistle a low, sweet, stirring
air. The little creature stopped at once
her movements of hands and feet, and
fixed her large eyes on him attentively.
He whistled more gaily and quickly, and
her face lighted up and answered with a
look of excitement, which he saw with a
bounding heart. Then he fell into a low,
sad minor, slow and tremulous, and in a
single moment her face responded. The
smiles all vanished, and, as he went on,
her eyes began to fill and she puckered up
her little mouth to cry.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and seized her in
his arms, clasping her against his throbbing
breast, and letting his tears fall over
her shining curls. He knew now beyond
any possibility of doubt that she had, in
one sense, at least, the gift he coveted for
her—an emotional susceptibility to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
influence of sound. This was enough to
make him feel that within his baby’s body
there was a soul to sympathize with him.
He believed, moreover, and the thrilling
conviction seemed to give wings to his
soul, that his child would show herself to
possess the gift of music in the creative
sense. Perhaps the little body, warm and
moist against him now, possessed within
itself that august mystery, a magnificent
human voice, or perhaps these exquisite
baby hands, pink and dimpled and satin,
smooth, were some day to command at
will the grand harmonies of melodious
sound. Ah, God! it was sweet to feel
that she was his—bone of his bone and
flesh of his flesh—body of his body—soul
of his soul!</p>

<p>She struggled a little in his constraining
embrace, and he loosed his clasp of her
and took her more naturally on his arm
and walked with her to an open window.
It was summer-time, and a bird was singing
in a tree outside. He saw her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
lighten as she heard the sound, and again
his heart throbbed faster.</p>

<p>At that moment the negro nurse came
into the room, and looked with astonishment
at the picture that met her. The
excitement through which the poor fellow
had gone made him feel weak and tremulous,
and he submitted quietly to have
the child taken from him and carried away.
His longing was to be alone, to utter
in some way his thanks to the Father
who had done this. In a few moments,
almost unconscious of what he was
doing, he found himself in his own little
private place, the dairy. Here he shut
himself in, and fell upon his knees. His
prayer of thanksgiving was confused, incoherent,
utterly insufficient. He rose in
the midst of the mumbled words, took his
violin, and began to play. It seemed to
ease the stress of his soul, and as he played
on, the tears overflowed his eyes. When
he laid by the violin he went over to the
piano and played great sounding chords.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
A strain of grand melody came into his
mind, and he found himself composing a
<i>Te Deum</i>—fitting the words to the sound
as they came to him, and feeling himself
wrapped in with ecstacy.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the new life
to Eastin. After that, he walked about the
common, familiar scenes, and saw them
clothed with an unfamiliar beauty; he felt
the world, no matter where he came into
contact with it, sweet and harmonious and
full of delight. He was absolutely, absorbingly
and sufficingly happy. The common
life about him seemed suddenly glorified,
and his heart expanded with an overflow of
loving good-will to all the world, that made
him see in his wife and other children attractions
and good points which he had
never seen before, or it may be, caused him
to imagine those which had no existence
at all, except in his new-made will to see
only goodness and sweetness everywhere.
He made timid efforts to interest and to
be of service to his wife and children, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
he was not perceptibly discouraged by
the fact that his overtures were regarded
with surprise, rather than appreciation,
for he had in one little creature a refuge
from every trouble, and a balm for every
wound.</p>

<p>As time went on, Rose-Jewel showed
every day new indications of a deep and
extraordinary feeling for music, and occasionally,
even in her babyhood, would pass
from her high, clear laughter into a little
carol of song, as spontaneous and incoherent
as a bird’s, and as thrillingly lovely.
One moment, he felt himself weakened
almost to helplessness by the sudden ebb
of blood from his heart; the next, as it
rushed back, he felt himself strengthened
with such might that nothing seemed too
great for him to do or to be. He soon became
aware of a necessity for vigilance, in
keeping his precious secret. His devotion
to the baby, of course, was observed, and
he was horribly afraid of having its cause
understood. He felt that trouble for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
both would come of it. He knew how
the mother would feel, and he had a deadly
fear of being separated from his idol. He
was relieved to find that his peculiar fancy
for this baby was looked upon as a fad,
for which his general oddness was enough
to account. It was a matter of practical
convenience to have so much of the care
of the baby taken off the hands of the
mother and the nurse, and so it was less
commented on.</p>

<p>Perhaps it enhanced the delights of this
companionship, that they were so often
stolen. There was a delicious sense of
mystery, in taking Rose-Jewel tenderly in
his arms and walking off down the garden-path
when nobody was looking, going
into the little room, closing the door, drawing
the curtain, and then, quite cut off
from all the rest of the world, enjoying
this most delightful of <i>tête-à-têtes</i>, where he
played with absolute freedom and unreserve,
to an audience that responded to
his touch, whether light or hard, grave or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
gay, more sensitively than the most perfect
instrument could have done.</p>

<p>To look into Rose-Jewel’s great delighted
eyes, across his violin, and to
see them gleam and glow with an emotion
that corresponded absolutely to his, was,
he thought, as keen a pleasure as he, or
mortal man beside had ever known.</p>

<p>In time it became a positive, thrilling,
marvelous certainty that Rose-Jewel had
a voice—a clear, true, strong little voice
that gave magnificent promise. Then
came the other delight, when she was older,
of teaching her to strike little melodies on
the piano, and even to put her baby fingers
on certain simple chords, as an accompaniment
to her father’s violin. The very
first time he made this effort, she caught
at it with a quickness and delight which
made his breath come almost suffocatingly.
It became, after that, a part of their daily
routine, to practice together. She was old
enough to talk coherently now, and he
often feared that she might betray their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
secret, but she seemed to have some wonderful
intuition of the truth, and never
even sang, except when alone with him.</p>

<p>What hours of stolen rapture the two
culprits had together! Sometimes they
wandered off and sat on the banks by the
river-side, and sometimes he lifted her into
the little boat, and, while she held the dear
violin safely and reverently, he would row
off into the stream, and there play to her
while they drifted gently about. In this
freedom of isolation he could play as it
was impossible to play near the house, with
an abandon of pleasure which set the child
nearly wild with delight. Here, too, he
would test and exercise her voice, with the
greatest care not to strain it, and here,
unseen by any eyes but those of the birds
and the squirrels, they would put their arms
around each other’s neck and give way to
a passion of tenderness of which both
the child as well as the man, would have
been incapable in the presence of others.
They were completely happy hours—happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> 
enough to atone for every pain and
deprivation which the past had held for
him, or the future might have in store.</p>

<p>He did not complain of the past, any
more than he feared the future for himself.
His one thought was the child.
When he speculated on her life to come,
a timorous dread would, in spite of him,
mix with the enthusiastic expectations of
her dazzling success in the musical world.
He would feast his imagination for hours,
on the thought of this. It was not the
splendor of music halls, nor the applause
of audiences that he coveted for his darling.
It was the power to touch the
hearts of men and women, and to incite
them to deeds of nobleness and strength,
that should re-echo through the world.</p>

<p>Always, however, those dreams of bliss
were poisoned by that haunting fear of
what the counteracting influence of the
child’s mother might be. It made him
shiver with terror, when he thought of that
bird of music which lived in Rose-Jewel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
breast, with its wings cut, and its song
stifled by the cold chill of disapproval, and
even a more active form of objection. He
imagined the harshness and contempt which
would fall upon that angelic child, if it
should be discovered that she had inherited
her father’s misfortune, and had been
encouraged in its development by him.
He thought of how broken and purposeless
his life had been made by the cold and
uncomprehending judgment of those about
him, and he felt weak with cowardice at
the thought of Rose-Jewel having the
same ordeal before her. He was ashamed
to feel himself powerless to help her in it.
He knew that nothing short of stealing the
child and keeping her hid would suffice,
and that he could not do. All the world
would consider him a monster, and he
would feel like one. Besides this, his
poverty would hinder. How could he
take his little song-bird out to be a pauper
with him? How could he even expect to
keep such a voice as he foresaw in her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
a secret? No,—God help the poor baby!—she
must stay and bear the blow when it
should come, and he, for his part, must do
what he could to help her—feeble as his
help would be!</p>

<p>He felt the danger coming nearer every
day, for Rose-Jewel was now able to sing
little songs with words and music, and the
more he felt the keen delight her delicious
little voice gave him, the more he trembled
at the thought of discovery. It was wonderful
how the child seemed to feel the
necessity of secrecy, and how, baby as she
was, she never gave any evidence of her
musical gifts, except when with her father.
Her childlike recollection of his warnings
surprised him.</p>

<p>One day the two were down in the old
dairy together. Eastin, with his violin
was playing the air of “Comin’ through
the Rye,” and Rose-Jewel was following
him, with her lisping utterance, and clear,
delicious voice, as she stood before him,
her eyes answering the look of his, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
definitely and truly as her voice answered
his instrument. When he played the
music to her baby pronunciation of the
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Every lathie hath her laddie,</div>
<div class="verse">None they thay have I—”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and her thrilling little voice rose to the
last high note, and took it with ease and
held it, the man’s hand shook so that the
bow dropped from it. For a few seconds,
the only sound was that almost inhuman
little treble voice, fine and thin as a hair,
but so thrillingly sweet that it sent a long
tremor all through Eastin’s limbs. Hurriedly
putting down his violin, he held out
his arms. The child flew into them, and
as he swooped her from the ground to his
heart, she finished, without accompaniment,
the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Yet all the ladth they thmile at me,</div>
<div class="verse">When comin’ thro’ the Rye.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He hugged her close and hard against
his heart. He had in her all that he cared
for, all that he had ever sought or desired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
his compensation for the bitter past, his
sufficiency for the uncertain future. His
heart was full of bliss.</p>

<p>A sound from behind aroused him.
The door was suddenly thrown open. He
turned, still clasping the child, and met
the infuriated eyes of the wife and mother.</p>

<p>The scene that followed was one that
roused him to a point of excitement he
had never known before. It was very
brief, but in those moments, in which
Rose-Jewel clung about his neck, while
her mother tried in vain to get possession
of her, while she seemed to appeal to him
for protection, and the very appeal seemed
to give him the power of response, he felt
himself, for the first time since his marriage,
a strong, self-reliant man, and a
sense of exultation swelled upward with
the surgings of his excited blood, until he
felt able to do and dare everything for the
sake of defending this child. His wife,
scarcely recognizing him in this unfamiliar
aspect, was for a moment surprised into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
silence, but the reaction after this made
her more angry yet, and the long restrained
indignation of years broke loose. She
gave it full vent, and he heard his beloved
art defamed and derided, and a possession
of the musical gift called a misfortune, a
nuisance and a curse. It was enough, she
said, to have borne with it in him, and
to have had calamity brought through
him into her life; but to go through it
again, with her own child—was more
than she could stand! She declared that
her confidence had been abused—that
Rose-Jewel should never be left one moment
alone with him again—that it should
be the object of her life, henceforth, to
suppress every sign of musical talent the
child might manifest—that she was resolved
to do this, if she had to whip her,
tie her, starve her, lock her up, a dozen
times a day. She looked into his eyes
defiantly, and warned him that the child
should not be spared! As he heard these
words come from her lips, he felt a tightening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
of the little arms around his neck.
The fire of his passionate love for his
baby was kindled into a keener flame, and
he wished it were possible never to loose
her from his arms. Her every second’s
absence from his sight would be torturing
anxiety to his heart.</p>

<p>When the mother came nearer, and
tried to take the little creature from him,
he threw out his disengaged arm and
warded her off, with a look in his eyes
which she felt to be dangerous, and somehow,
to her own surprise, it checked her.
Rose-Jewel, terrified by the only half-comprehended
threats of the mother, cried
piteously on his neck, and even while to
the excited woman before him he showed
a spirit of daring, of which he knew he had
never been capable until that minute, he
was soothing and reassuring the child with
soft, caressing sounds and touches, and
inwardly vowing that, no matter what happened,
he would never be separated from
her—never give her up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>His wife saw that unknown look of
resolution in his eyes, and felt compelled
by it to yield her point.</p>

<p>She drew back a few steps, and after a
moment’s hesitation, said:</p>

<p>“I won’t attempt to reason with a man
who is out of his mind, for that is what
you are, at present. Of course, if you
choose to exercise force toward a woman,
you are too strong for me. But, when I
get my child back, I shall know how to
keep her.”</p>

<p>“She is my child, too,” he answered,
“and you shall never get her away from
me. I will never give her up to you, or
to any one.”</p>

<p>These words were said more by way of
reassurance to the sobbing child than to
the mother. He had felt Rose-Jewel
draw him closer, as she heard her mother’s
threat, and he answered the baby’s touch,
rather than the woman’s words.</p>

<p>“You are too excited to see how foolish
your words are,” answered his wife coldly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
“but no one expects any practical sense
from you. Rose-Jewel,” she added, with
a sudden tone of harsh authoritativeness,
“if you don’t stop that crying, I shall
punish you for it. I’m going now, and
your papa can keep you, but, to-night,
you’ll have to come to me, and I’ll see if
I can’t make you a better girl.”</p>

<p>As the mother left the room, Eastin felt
the child’s sobbing increase. She uttered
little stifled cries of terror that cut him to
the very soul.</p>

<p>“There, my Rose, my Jewel, my Bird,”
he said. “Don’t you be frightened. No
one shall take Papa’s baby away from him.
Papa’ll keep her, right in his arms, and
never let her go out of them, that’s what
he’ll do. Nobody shall lay their fingers
on his baby.”</p>

<p>He said recklessly anything that he
thought would reassure her, but, even
while he spoke, he felt oppressed and terrified
at the impossibility of performing what
he was promising. His heart felt like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
lead, when he realized that he would <i>have</i>
to give her up—that he would, in a few
hours, now, at best, be forced to see her
taken from him, struggling, crying, terrified,
to begin her initiation into a life of
torture, and that, when she left his arms,
he could never take her back to them,
in the same way, forever. All the privacy
and sacredness of their intercourse was
gone, even if, as was doubtful, he was ever
allowed to have her again. And when
she was out of his sight, what would be
his dread about her? She had been threatened
with blows, starvation, and revengeful
anger, if she ever tried to play or sing
again—and to stop her music would seem
to him like murdering her soul.</p>

<p>A longing for the old isolation of freedom
came upon him. They might have
it once again! He reached for his violin
and bow and put them into the case.
Then, still holding the child pressed close
against him, he took up the case with his
free hand, and went out of the opened door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>It was a mild, overcast summer day.
The very act of getting out of doors exhilarated
and strengthened him. He spoke
gay and encouraging words to the child, as
he carried her down the little, well-worn
path which led to the river, without going
in sight of the house. They had often
gone along this path together, and when he
reached the bank and loosed the little boat
tied there, and put Rose-Jewel down on
the cushion in the bottom, with the violin
against her feet, they were only re-enacting
old familiar scenes of companionship and
delight.</p>

<p>Eastin took up the small paddle that lay
in the boat, and pushed out into the stream.
The river was perfectly placid on days
like this, and it was his delight to get off
with the child a little way from land and
to play to her. The boat scarcely moved
upon the water, and they did not go out
far enough to get into the current. It was
in the wide and sleepy part of the stream
above the narrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>The child had grown completely quiet
now, and looked up at him with a face of
unclouded happiness as he laid down the
paddle and took his violin out of its case.
He put it in perfect tune, and then, with
that radiant presence opposite him, began
to play.</p>

<p>On his own heart the shadow of a great
dread hung heavy. He felt that this hour
separated the dear and beautiful past from
a future full of pain and wrangling, and
even of cruelty and harshness. He would
have to make a desperate fight with his
wife for the soul and body of the child,
and he felt that everything was against
him. It was inevitable that he should be
conquered, and what would it all mean to
his darling? He looked into her beautiful,
confiding little face, and it almost broke
his heart. He resolved that she should
be happy, for this hour, at least.</p>

<p>He played to her gay dance music, and
she clapped her hands in time to it, and
rocked her little body about, until the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
moved with her motion, and made them
seem to be dancing. Eastin helped this
effect by patting his foot and shaking his
head, and answering audibly her little cries
of glee. He passed from waltz to polka,
and from polka to <i>galop</i>, the child, conforming
to every change of time; and
Eastin, remembering that it was their last
free hour together, got intoxicated with the
delight of it, and bewildered by the thought
of its fleetingness played faster and faster,
nodding his head in time to Rose-Jewel’s
motions, and never taking his eyes from
her face.</p>

<p>At last, with a final scrape of the bow,
the exciting measure ended, and he dropped
his arms with a wild and breathless laugh,
to which the child responded.</p>

<p>But how was it that, although both their
tired bodies had grown still and relaxed,
that sense of movement continued? Eastin
felt a spasm of fear at his heart, and
looking about him he discovered that they
were far from the shore, and in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
center of the stream, whose current was
bearing them rapidly onward, and every
moment becoming stronger and swifter.
He realized, in one awful instant, that they
had been drifting for some time, and were
quickly getting into the narrows. He
looked ahead and could see the high cliffs
of rocks on either side, which, for unknown
ages of time, had been the impregnable
bounds of that crowding torrent of waves
and spray and bubbling foam that rushed
onward to the falls below.</p>

<p>He reached for the little paddle, but he
felt it would be useless. Every moment
the motion was becoming stronger and
more irresistible. He scarcely felt the
thin planks between him and the seething
stream below. He put out the paddle, but
one blow from that bounding water knocked
it from his hand and hurled it away, and
he could see it tossed from wave to wave
with a sportive motion that seemed to mock
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought occurred to him, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
which his heart gave a great bound, and a
light, as it had been from heaven, overspread
his face. He knew that rescue
was impossible, and the idea that God had
planned for him and for Rose-Jewel this
release from the pain of earth and this entrance
into the glory of heaven swept over
him with a wave of joy. There were no
words that he had ever said more devoutly
than, “I believe in the forgiveness of
sins,” and he knew Rose-Jewel was already
a companion for the angels. The
vision of a certain ecstacy and bliss shone
all around about him. O the freedom of
it, the rapture, the music! Even the
dread of physical death was nothing to
him. Rose-Jewel would be his companion,
and the journey would be short!</p>

<p>His one care was that the child should
not be frightened. She had always answered
to his control, and he took up the
violin now and began to play.</p>

<p>“Listen, darling, listen!” he said, holding
her eyes with his own, and drowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
in a flood of rich, keen melody the noise
of the rushing water.</p>

<p>And Rose-Jewel answered to the insistence
of those swelling sounds of music as
unquestioningly as she had ever done.
She forgot everything, as she bent forward
to listen. He leaned close to her, that
she might not lose one sound. The
beauty of the music that swelled out over
those turbulent waters was entrancing,
even to himself. He did not know what
he was playing—something he had never
heard before, but something fit to play in
those choirs of heaven to which he was
going so quickly. He could not wonder
that the child was under the spell of it.
It came to him without one interruption—an
unbroken strain of divinest sweetness,
such as he had never heard before.
In the very midst of it, the ever-narrowing,
ever-quickening current gave the little
boat such a wrench, that the violin was
knocked out of his hand into the leaping
waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>Then Rose-Jewel gave a little cry, and
turned to look about her, but before she
had faced the sight of those terrifying
waves, he caught her in his arms. She
felt her little golden head drawn down
upon its sweet, familiar resting-place, and
the arms of her father folded close about
her. Words of love and comfort and
reassurance were whispered in her ear.
She was being rocked into repose and rest
quite naturally, as she had so often been
before, upon her father’s breast.</p>

<p>There was a sudden rush of something
cold and strange—a swish of sound—a
lurch—a fall—and then, still holding each
other in the dear fondness of that close
embrace, the musician and his little child
sank together into death, and their spirits
soared forth into infinite music.</p>

</div>

<p>The only objection which Edward Randall
had to his new bachelor apartments
was found in the fact, that they looked out
upon some very dingy, dull, and gloomy
houses opposite. This had been his chief
obstacle in deciding to take these rooms, but
there were advantages which soon proved
a sufficient offset.</p>

<p>The fact that he was the only lodger
in Mrs. Green’s extremely well-ordered
house, and that the elderly widow had
a delicate feeling for his old china and
other perishable property, and looked after
the cleaning and arranging of his rooms,
herself, was a great thing for him; and the
fact, also, that his back windows looked out
upon a beautiful little bit of old garden and
a wealth of greenery made the other outlook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
seem comparatively unimportant. He
had the whole of Mrs. Green’s second
floor, and beyond the sitting-room there
was a pleasant, vine-screened porch supplied
with hammocks and easy chairs,
where, when the weather was mild, he
could sit and smoke with his friends, or
read or meditate, as the humor of the hour
dictated.</p>

<p>He was not over thirty-five, and yet the
fact was universally conceded that he was
a confirmed bachelor—a matter of some
regret to those of his friends who held that
in that condition his good income, personal
attractions, and lovable domestic qualities
were more or less wasted.</p>

<p>The front view from his chambers being
unpleasing to him, and the back view
decidedly pleasing, he rarely drew aside the
curtains of the former room, but one morning
when he was rather idle, and also in
a state of some uncertainty about the
weather, he went to look out into the
street to help him to decide whether or not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to go out before lunch. It was Sunday
and rather cloudy, and it seemed to him
that the shabby buildings opposite looked
duller and dingier than ever, when his
attention was caught by the opening of the
door of the house directly facing him, and
the appearance on the threshold of a young
girl. She, too, it seemed, was in some
uncertainty about the weather, for she
came out on the steps and turned her face
upwards to investigate the clouds. In this
way, Randall was enabled to get a full and
satisfactory view of this upturned face,
which was very beautiful—so beautiful,
in fact, that he felt the survey all too brief,
and was conscious of a sense of strong
protest when the girl, with an air of decision,
shook out the folds of a thick blue
veil and fastened it around her hat, then
taking up her umbrella and a little book,
which she had laid aside in order to pin on
her veil, quickly descended the steps and
walked away.</p>

<p>Randall watched her as far as he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and noted carefully every detail of her
dress, which certainly bordered on shabbiness,
and was poor and plain in material,
and yet had for him a certain charm. It
could only have been her figure and her
movements which gave this impression,
for, contrasted with some very smart young
ladies who walked in front of her, she was
an object dull and colorless enough. These
young ladies had their faces frankly bared
to observation, but Randall turned from
them with distaste, to recall the pure young
beauty of the face now closely screened
behind that thick veil.</p>

<p>He wondered much about the young
girl, for she was undoubtedly rarely beautiful,
and there was an impression caught
from her appearance which distinctly
charmed him. The sight of the little book
in her hand, together with the ringing of
the church bells, assured him that she was
on her way to church, and for the first
time for a very long while, he felt like
going to church, himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>It was much too late to think of this,
however, for his toilet was not begun, and
so he turned back within the room, and
lounging in dressing-gown and slippers,
spent an hour reading the morning papers
and smoking. At the end of that time, he
started up suddenly and began his toilet,
with an air of haste and impatience. As
soon as he was dressed, he took his hat
and gloves and went downstairs. Just as
he opened the front door, he caught sight
of the young girl mounting the steps opposite,
on her return home. She was in the
act of taking off her veil, and Randall
thought she did so with a certain air of
relief from a bondage which irked her.
Once more he got a brief impression of
that young and exquisite face, and then,
without having looked at him at all, she
opened the door with a latch-key and
entered the gloomy old house, and the
dingy door closed behind her.</p>

<p>Randall went his way, and presently
found himself seated at a beautifully appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
lunch table with a party of gay
and brilliant people, among whom he was
made very welcome, and where he laughed
and chattered for an hour, but throughout
it all he could not shake off the impression
that this girl had made upon him, and her
pure, young face, and plain, dark garments
rose before his vision, as alien to this
scene as the impression of some rapt,
ascetic nun.</p>

<p>After lunch there was a general demand
that Mr. Randall should play to them, and
rather more obligingly than usual he
yielded to the request, and, going to the
piano, he began with certain powerful
chords and impressive pauses, that soon
compelled the company to perfect silence
and attention. He was a fine musician,
and quite accustomed to having his playing
treated deferentially, but he did not often
take the trouble to play to people as he
was playing now. His audience had expected
something light and brilliant, and
instead of that it was only sacred music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
that he played—harmonies and masses
from the great masters of old, with an improvised
arrangement and connection of
his own.</p>

<p>He rose from the piano and said good-bye
abruptly, hurrying away from the
enthusiastic praise of his audience, and
walking quickly back to his lodgings,
where he spent the remainder of the day.
Some men dropped in to see him, but
either they were hurried, or they found
him unamusing, for they presently went
away, and at twilight he was left alone.</p>

<p>More than once, he had gone to look
out on the opposite house, but the dull,
gray front of that dismal structure was
unsuggestive of the least hint of its radiant
young inmate. When the lamps were
lighted, at last, and the curtains drawn, and
the servant, having attended to his comfort,
had left him quite alone for the evening,
he opened his piano and began to
play. It must have been for hours that
he sat there, with no music before him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
playing on and on, thinking, thinking,
thinking to those beautiful strains.</p>

<p>Of course, he did not fancy anything
so absurd as that he was in love with this
young girl, whose face and nearness so
possessed him; that was out of the question.
But what he did feel was that a
quality in her face had roused to new
being a certain ideal which had once held
him, and which in recent years had been
losing its hold.</p>

<p>Randall had an ardent and romantic
nature, subdued by circumstance and rearing
into conventional conformity. The
passion of his life was music, and although
he was a more or less earnest and successful
lawyer, the hearing of good music and
the cultivation of his own musical gift was
the strongest interest of his life. His
friends wondered that he had not married,
and, to tell the truth, he wondered at
that fact as much as they. If they were
ignorant of his reason though, he, himself,
was not. He knew well that it was because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
he had, so far in life, met no woman
whose nature and personality made the
appeal to him, and satisfied the desire of
his soul, in the way that music appealed to
and satisfied him, and what he wondered
at was, that in all his wide acquaintance he
had never seen this woman. He had
grown tired of looking for her, at last, and
had even deliberately considered the advisability
of marrying a person who would
have compelled a lowering of his ideal.
A real, definite woman had been considered
in this light, a woman with beauty,
good breeding, position, and money, whom
he thought he might win; but this woman
not only was not musical herself, but she
contradicted the ideal which seemed to go
hand in hand with music in his soul.</p>

<p>No, certainly he was not in love with
this opposite neighbor of his, but the remarkable
effect which she had had upon
him was to rouse in him the belief of the
possibility of realizing this vanished ideal.
There was something in her that seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
to tell him that what he had dreamed of
might still be. It was her face only that
had done this. He had not seen the outline
of her figure, for that had been concealed
by a long black cloak, that was
loose from neck to hem. And even more
than this, he had not heard her voice.
Randall had always conceived that his
ideal woman would sing, though that was
not a necessity with him, but he was so
susceptible to the influence of sound that
a coarse, or nasal, or discordant voice,
even in speaking, would have killed the
most fiery love that charm or beauty could
arouse. He suddenly felt a great desire
to know if this exquisite girl could sing,
or to hear her speak. It was not so much
an emotional stirring of love which she
had aroused in him, as a sort of spirit
of intellectual investigation. He knew
that she had a face that might belong to
his ideal woman, and he wondered if her
voice would carry out the idea.</p>

<p>These thoughts absorbed him, while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
was playing, and he began to imagine plans
by which he might hear her speak or sing.
He could think of nothing, except to follow
her to church some Sunday, and get a
seat near her in the hope that she might
join in the hymns, but the girl evidently
went out alone and unprotected, and he
could not quite get his consent to following
and watching her.</p>

<p>Well, whoever she was, and whatever
her nature and qualities, she had certainly
managed to make a greater impression on
the not very susceptible mind of Mr.
Edward Randall, than that mind had received
for many a long day. He went to
sleep that night with a sense of newness
and strangeness upon him, and he waked
next morning with a distinct impression
that some important change had come into
his life. When he remembered what it
was he smiled at himself; but all the same,
the impression remained.</p>

<p>For several days Randall watched the
house opposite, in the hope of seeing again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
this charming girl; but it was in vain.
Other people came and went, for the
house was evidently let out to lodgers, but
they were of the most uninteresting of the
lodging-house class; indeed, as a rule,
they were such people as it irked him
to think of as living under the same roof
with the lovely girl.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, as he was
going out he saw coming down the steps
opposite a tall, slight figure in a long,
black cloak, which he recognized at once,
though this time the face was carefully
veiled before coming into the street. This
fact seemed a little singular, as it was
getting on toward twilight of a mild spring
day. He kept the tall figure well in sight,
as he happened to be going the same way,
and even crossed the street that he might
observe her more directly. This fact put
a wide space between them which even
his rapid walking did not soon decrease,
as the woman’s figure moved very swiftly,
and as if with some definite and important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
object. When she came at last to one of
the small public parks that relieved the
sense of dense habitation of that part of
the great city, Randall observed ahead of
her a little gathering of people, mostly
children, who had collected around an object
which he at once recognized.</p>

<p>A cart and horse were drawn up to the
sidewalk, and in this light wagon was a
small, upright piano. The instrument was
open, and a man with a small black mask
concealing that part of the face which was
not hidden by a black beard, sat on the stool
before it, waiting. Randall had seen this
sort of thing in London, but it was new
to him here. It had no interest for him,
however, and he would not have given the
thing another thought had not the woman’s
figure, which he was watching, crossed directly
over to this cart and the man before
the piano recognized her with a gesture of
satisfaction. He further saw her go straight
to the side of the cart, where she paused a
moment to take off her veil, revealing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
fact that she was masked, also. A close
covering of black satin hid the upper part
of her face, and a frill of black lace concealed
the mouth and chin. The disguise
was absolute, and he could have formed
no idea of the appearance of the woman,
had it not been for the vivid image stamped
upon his memory.</p>

<p>He felt a sense of shock at seeing her
placed in such a position—a girl with a
face like that, a common street singer!
True, the face was hidden from view, but
that air of concealment and mystery made
it seem almost worse. He rebelled, evidently,
too, against the thought of the man
with his shabby clothes and unkempt beard.
He had half a mind to turn and fly, but if
she was going to sing he must hear her
voice. If it should not match her face,
he would be bitterly disappointed—but if,
on the other hand, it should, how could he
bear her being in such a situation as the
present one?</p>

<p>As he saw the tall, slight figure mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
into the cart, Randall felt so really agitated
over the issue ahead of him, that he sank
upon one of the benches in the square and
waited with intense interest for the music
to begin. Some chords were struck upon
the piano, introducing a brief prelude,
which the masked man executed in a way
that proved him, to Randall’s cultivated
ear, to be a well-trained pianist. But while
the young man recognized this fact, he
looked only at the woman. She wore
above her mask a hat with a little brim,
under which her hair was all concealed,
and between this and the shape of the
mask, which was so made as to stand a
little out from the upper part of the face,
he could not catch even a glimpse of her
eyes. Randall had a swift mental vision
of the loveliness, pureness, ideality of that
hidden face, that stirred his heart with a
vague sweetness, when suddenly upon this
tender mood there fell a sound which made
a discord in the harmony.</p>

<p>It was a woman’s voice, singing a popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
air in a manner so finished and correct
that the method of it startled him with
surprise and appreciation, even while the
voice itself repelled him. He listened
intently to every note. What was the
matter with this voice? It was that of a
thoroughly trained and practiced singer,
and yet it seemed as if, in some way, it had
been hurt. The low notes were hard and
husky, the high notes were thin and weak.
All of this might be accounted for by some
disastrous illness or throat trouble, but
even while he made this allowance, there
was something in the quality, or character,
or individuality of the voice, itself, even
when singing the middle notes, which
caused no strain, that stung the man who
listened with a sharp pang of disappointment—a
certain quality of hardness, even
commonness, which was the direct contradiction
of that fair and sensitive young
face.</p>

<p>The selection ended, and Randall,
drawing a deep breath, roused himself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
looked around upon the crowd which had
gathered. They were a motley throng,
composed of children, nurses, tramps,
policemen, and aimless idlers of various
classes. When Randall remembered the
girl’s face, his heart resented them all violently;
when he thought of her voice, the
tones of which still lingered in his ear, he
did not care!</p>

<p>But the voice was beginning again, and
again he turned and listened. This time
it was Schubert’s serenade that she sang,
and her technique seemed to him absolutely
perfect. Her voice, however, was
colder, poorer, more expressionless than
before, and he rose as it ended, with an
impatient desire to get away. He could
have stood any fault of method, had the
voice itself been beautiful and sympathetic,
but the voice distinctly antagonized him.
Before he had moved from his place, however,
he saw the woman getting out of the
cart with a little basket in her hand, and
he remembered that he was supposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
pay for the feast of which he had just partaken.
He sat down again, and waited for
her to come to him.</p>

<p>As she drew nearer, and he heard the
small coins clinking lightly in the basket,
a feeling of what was almost disgust took
possession of him. He saw looks of bold
curiosity turned upon her from every side.
He even heard certain comments, which,
when he thought of the face upturned to
the sky that Sunday morning, made him
hot with indignation. When he recalled
the voice, however, he was able to control
himself.</p>

<p>As the singer approached him, he saw
that her eyes, of which he sought eagerly
to catch a glimpse, were uniformly cast
down, so that even when the light fell so
as to enable him to penetrate the shadows
of the mask, he saw only a pair of lowered
lids.</p>

<p>An idea struck him, and as she came
toward him he took a silver dollar from
his pocket and dropped it into the basket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
He hoped that the unusual size of the
coin might cause her to look up, but it did
not. She made a little gesture of acknowledgment,
as she had done for the pennies
and dimes already received, and walked
swiftly on. Even the hand that held the
basket was covered by a thick glove, which
revealed nothing of its shape or character.</p>

<p>As she remounted to her place, handing
the basket over to the man, who poured the
contents into his pocket, Randall walked
away. His pace quickened suddenly, as he
heard behind him the voice that had so
repelled him, singing with that beautiful
method, which compelled admiration in
spite of himself, the words and music of
“After the Ball.”</p>

<p>The effect of this experience upon Randall
was to make him resolve to put his
opposite neighbor completely out of his
head, a thing he might have accomplished,
but for a circumstance which occurred the
very next morning.</p>

<p>The day was very mild and beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
and his front windows had been left wide
open by the maid who had done up his
room. Randall went to one of them,
and stood with the lace curtains shoved
aside by his elbows, his hands resting
lightly in his pockets. The people over
the way seemed to be making the most
of the spring sunshine also, for the windows
were open all along, and in some
cases, even the doors. The streets, still
damp from yesterday’s rainfall, were sending
up a faint steam under the warm sunshine,
and there seemed to be a perfect
epidemic of pavement cleaning in progress.
Servant maids with hose or brooms were
working away vigorously, and the fresh
young green on the budding branches rose
above all this, as if the toilets of the trees
had been completed before those of the
pavements were begun.</p>

<p>Randall had determined to forget his
neighbor with the beautiful face and unbeautiful
voice, and in order that he might
emphasize this resolution, he looked hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
at the door of her house, which happened
to be one of those that stood open.</p>

<p>He could not penetrate far into the dark
chasm of a hall which the opening revealed,
but as he looked, out of the darkness there
sprang a jet black object, which, as it
bounded into the street, he saw to be a
rather large black kitten. He knew from
its precipitous rush that someone must be
after it, and the someone proved to be
the beautiful young girl.</p>

<p>If she had been beautiful before, with
her long dark cloak and the severe little
hat that hid both her head and her hair,
what was she now, in a fresh pink cotton
gown that revealed every curve of her
slight and exquisite young figure, and her
lovely face, surmounted by a rippling mass
of bright gold-brown hair.</p>

<p>As Randall looked down on her through
the budding green of the trees, she seemed
of a piece with them, as if she might be
the bloom that was the consummation of
all their verdant leafage. Instinctively, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
stepped back behind the curtains, and concealing
himself, carefully watched the
scene that followed. The black kitten,
evidently used to games of romps with its
mistress, had scudded wildly down the
steps and scrambled up into the veranda
of the next house, where it sat complacently
on the railing, to see what was to
follow. The girl, with a look that was a
compound of desperation and amusement,
sat down on the steps, with the evident
intention of coaxing the kitten to come to
her.</p>

<p>“Minnie, Minnie, Minnie!” she said
enticingly, holding out a lovely hand and
making little curling gestures with the
delicate fingers. At the sound of her
voice, raised a little high, so as to reach
the kitten, Randall started and caught his
breath. It was musical, clear, refined,
harmonious, the very complement of her
face and figure! He had heard of such
things, where some serious illness or injury
had ruined a voice for singing, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
left its speaking quality untouched! Oh,
why should she ever sing, he thought!
And why should he ever have had the
misfortune to hear her? All the time
that he was thinking these thoughts, that
vision of youthful loveliness was there
before his eyes.</p>

<p>Her figure was charming, as she sat on
the doorstep and continued to coax the
kitten, in that beautiful voice of appeal;
but it was more than charming, it was
adorable, as she rose to her feet and, with
stealthy motions of consummate grace,
began to creep toward the kitten, which sat,
with a wary pretense of unconsciousness,
perched upon the railing. At last, when
she was very near, and the kitten as still
as a statue, she darted forward and had
almost seized it, when with the agility of
a squirrel, the little black creature, with
one mad rush, sprang to the pavement,
flew across the street, and scrambling up
the rough trunk of an old wistaria vine, in
a flutter of fun and excitement darted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
through the open window, and jumped into
Randall’s room.</p>

<p>In an instant he captured it, and running
down stairs and out of the front door
bareheaded, he swiftly crossed the muddy
street to the detriment of his patent leather
boots, and gave the kitten into the hands
of its young mistress, who stood spellbound
on the pavement, in startled wonderment
at this sudden prank of her pet.</p>

<p>It was a quiet street, and there was no
one in sight except, at a little distance, the
servants, who were so busy with their
swishing and sweeping that apparently
they had not observed the little scene.</p>

<p>Randall, as he stood there, in the sweet
spring sunshine, face to face with this
creature of his dreams and thoughts, took
in every detail of her blooming loveliness,
more rich than ever now, by reason of a
brilliant blush which had come into her
face. As she received the kitten from
his hands she said a demure, “Thank
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Thank <i>you</i>,” he answered, “for the
opportunity of seeing such a feat. You
could match your kitten with a squirrel,
any day, and I’m afraid your chance of
holding on to it, in a city, is very small.”</p>

<p>“O, I never let him get out!” she said
with sudden anxiety. “He fooled me this
time, but he shall not do it again,” and as
she spoke she gave the offender a sharp little
slap, which so excited it, that with a sudden
wrench it sprang from her arms and
bounded away, she and Randall following
in mad pursuit. Randall had once done
notable running in a football team at college,
and in the frantic spurt with which he
darted after the kitten, his old training told,
and he quickly overtook and captured it.
When he turned and faced the kitten’s
mistress, both of them were flushed and
laughing, and rather breathless.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind you are! Oh, you
little brute!” the girl exclaimed, addressing
the man and the kitten in one breath.
As she held out her hands to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
struggling creature from him, he drew it
back.</p>

<p>“No, I will take him as far as the door
for you,” he said. “He’s not in the least
to be trusted, and would be off and away
now, if he could. Poor little beast! I fancy
it’s hard to be shut up in a close house all
the time, and the chance of escape was too
much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he misses the country so, and so
do I! I ought to have pity on Tommy,
for I’d run from the city, too, if I could,
and if I saw an open door.”</p>

<p>They had reached the house now, and
mounted the steps, side by side. He made
her go inside and close the door, leaving
just enough space for him to hand the
wriggling Tommy through. As the little
black object passed from his hands to hers,
she looked up at him out of the gloom within,
and said a fervent, “Thank you.” Her
glance was frank and simple as a child’s,
but, all the same, it sent him back across
the street with a heart whose quick thumping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
was not wholly due to the rather violent
exercise which he had had.</p>

<p>Randall returned to the meditations of
his own room more puzzled than ever; and
if his interest in the girl of whom he had
simply had a glimpse from afar, had been
great before, what was it now that he had
seen, in the glaring sunlight, only a pace or
two away from him, the exquisite perfection
of her loveliness, and had heard the refined
and educated utterance of a voice which
lingered in his ear as one of the very sweetest
to which he had ever listened? Then,
too, her impetuously expressed longing for
the country, and hatred of the city, seemed
a strange note to be struck by this being,
whom with his own eyes he had seen as a
common street musician, truckling to the
vulgar taste of a crowd of loafers, and holding
out her hands to receive their dirty
pennies. As he recalled the scene, the
memory of that strident, ineffectual, hard,
discordant voice came to him, and he found
himself in a state of tempestuous protest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
against the whole thing. How could that
fair, idyllic girl descend to the playing of
such a part, and how could such singing
go with such a face and figure? He had
looked in vain for any signs of illness
which might account for it. She seemed
the emblem of eternal youth and health.
Then came the memory of that look that
she had flashed upon him from the gloom,
and brought with it certain thoughts and
aspirations, which had not been stirred
within him for long and saddened years.</p>

<p>The Sunday after the episode with the
kitten, Randall came out of his lodgings
at a little before eleven o’clock, and saw
across the street, just ahead of him, the
well-known figure in the long black cloak,
with the close veil around the face. He
had watched the opposite house for days,
but had not caught a glimpse of this figure.
Other lodgers came and went (for the
house seemed a crowded one), but not the
one he sought. He had started out rather
aimlessly this morning, and he saw no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
reason why, in taking his airing, he should
not keep the graceful figure ahead of him
in view, particularly as he, himself, could
not have been observed by her. So, for a
long distance he walked after her on the
other side of the street, until at last she
turned and joined the straggling stream of
people that seemed setting toward a small
new church—one of the little mission
places so common now in our great cities.
Randall quoted to himself the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“She went to a cheap, cheap church</div>
<div class="verse">That stood in a back, back street,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and smiled at the thought of the new complicatedness
of the aspect of things. And
when she joined the crowd and entered, a
sudden wish to go to church himself came
over him, and he saw no reason why he
should not indulge it. He did so accordingly,
and being told that the seats were all
free, he presently found himself placed a
little behind the young girl, so that he
could have a distinct view of her profile
during the entire service. He was secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
in the consciousness that he had not been
observed, and his presence, therefore, could
cause her no annoyance. He watched her
furtively as she sank upon her knees, burying
her veiled face in two exquisite little
shabbily-gloved hands, and remained for
some moments in silent prayer. What a
wretch of a creature he suddenly felt himself
to be, and what a yearning he had to
ask her to pray for him!</p>

<p>When she got up presently and took
her seat, his heart quickened to see her
raise her hand to unfasten her veil. How
odd it appeared that no one else seemed to
be noticing or caring! The congregation
was composed chiefly of people with stolid
faces and rather dull expressions, and
Randall was further surprised to see that
no one manifested any interest when this
beautiful young face was exposed to view.
He had occasion, however, to congratulate
himself upon this indifference, since it extended
to himself, as well, and left him free
to look toward his lovely neighbor very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
often. He had to admit that she was as
unconscious of the rest of the congregation
as he, though no one else that he
could see betrayed such absorbed consciousness
of the effect of the service. It
was a high-church service, and this young
girl went through all the rather elaborate
forms with an intense devotion and absorption,
that for some unknown reason
almost made him feel resentful.</p>

<p>The more Randall looked at her, the
more lovely and lovable did she appear.
It was quite, quite the most beautiful face
that he had ever seen, he decided, and his
heart was somehow more attuned to worship
to-day than he had felt it for many a
year.</p>

<p>At last, a hymn was given out, and the
congregation rose. Randall jumped up
rather suddenly with a positive instinct of
flight. He did not want to hear her sing.
He could not bear to stand so near and
see those most lovely lips part and send
forth such a voice as he knew, alas, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
issue from them! But while he hesitated,
the music began, and the sweet lips remained
closed and immovable, except for
a little tremor which he fancied he saw,
as the girl’s eyes followed the words in
her book.</p>

<p>When the hymn ended, and the congregation
knelt, he saw the young girl hide
her face in her handkerchief for a moment,
and then, quickly take up her thick veil
and pin it on securely.</p>

<p>He let her go ahead of him on leaving
the church, as he did not wish to be
observed. He did not follow her home,
however, but went instead to the club, and
joined a group of chattering men in a bay-window,
and listened for half an hour to
their vapid comments on the smartly-dressed
men and women who went by,
feeling all the time a dull ache in his heart
for that sensitive, lonely, probably unhappy
girl, whose loveliness, even in her shabby
clothes in that little mission chapel, made
the most fashionable of the women who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
passed him seem trivial and vulgar by
comparison.</p>

<p>For several days, Randall carried this
lovely vision in his mind, until one afternoon,
in a populous business neighborhood,
he came suddenly upon a group of people
assembled around the familiar horse and
cart and the pair of musicians. He wanted
to retreat, but he forced himself to stop
and join the crowd, wondering what effect
his presence would have upon her, if she
should see and recognize him. So he
took his place conspicuously, and listened
with indignant protest as she sang, in
popular style, with a vulgar abandon that
made him positively furious, the familiar
strains of “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!”</p>

<p>The voice was grating and unlovely as
before, but again he felt amazed at the
marvelous method of the singer, and the
spirit with which she gave the song called
forth an encore, after which she got out
of the cart and passed around the basket.
When she came to Randall, he purposely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
fumbled several seconds with his change,
hoping that she might look up at him, but
when she persistently looked down, he
fancied that if she saw him, she was
ashamed to reveal herself to him. Well
she might be, he thought, and tossing
some loose coins into the basket, he was
about to walk away, when he heard a man
standing near say some words to the
woman as she held out her basket to him,
which roused such fury in Randall’s soul,
that before the insult had died upon the
fellow’s lips, he found himself seized by
the shoulders, and hurled aside with a blow
from so powerful an arm that it sent him
staggering against a tree. At the same instant,
Randall saw the woman, with a
movement of fright, run swiftly toward
the cart. Before she reached the cart,
however, the man at the piano had sprung
from his place, and had rushed after the
fellow whose words had caused the disturbance,
but who, warned by the punishment
which he had already received, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
made the best use of his time and had
escaped. Seeing this, the pianist turned
and, coming toward Randall, said in a
voice of controlled agitation, “I am very
much obliged to you, sir, for what you
did.”</p>

<p>Randall, who was in a state of disgust
at the whole performance, waved aside the
man’s thanks, and rapidly walked away.</p>

<p>During the weeks that followed, Randall
was a prey to conflicting impressions, that
kept him in a continual state of excitement
and restlessness. He had got up
an interest in the working of the mission
chapel, and the evident help which it gave
to those poor working people, and it
pleased him to find a really satisfactory
object for the expenditure of some of his
spare cash, so he went to church every
Sunday there, and contributed liberally to
the work. He did not deceive himself as
to the prime object of his attendance. He
knew it was because his beautiful neighbor
went there, but his interest in the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
was sincere. He had more than once
encountered the young girl in coming
and going from the church, and upon
these occasions it was his habit to lift
his hat and to bow respectfully, just as it
was her habit to return this greeting by a
brilliant and beautifying blush. It made
her adorably lovely, and as she now habitually
removed her veil before entering the
church, and did not replace it until after
leaving, he had the full benefit of it. If
he chanced to meet her on the street away
from the church, she was always closely
veiled, but usually he managed to bow to
her, as she was entering or leaving.</p>

<p>But if the experiences of his Sundays
gave him pleasure, it was more than counterbalanced
by the pain he felt in the
experiences of his week days. Try as he
might to avoid the humiliating spectacle
(and he did make a great effort) he was
liable at any turn to run against that rusty
cart, sleepy old pony, and the pair of musicians.
He had had a sort of hope that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
experience with the brute who had insulted
the girl would stop these performances for
the future, but he found that they went on
just the same as ever. He could only
conclude from this, that the man who performed
with her was oblivious of, or indifferent
to, her need of protection.</p>

<p>Randall did not always sit near her
in church. Sometimes he even forced
himself to take a seat where he could not
look at her at all, but it was something to
him to feel her nearness. One Sunday,
however, he thought he had won the right
to treat himself to an unusual indulgence
of proximity, so on entering the church,
after she had taken her usual place, he
quietly walked into the seat on a line with
her, and took his place near the end, where
he was only separated from her by the
partition dividing the pews. Never in his
life had his manner been more quiet and
composed, than as he sat there, profoundly
still, with his eyes fixed attentively upon the
preacher. He knew that she had recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
him, and he was perfectly confident
that she blushed, but no one observing
him would have seen in his manner anything
but the coldest composure. It was,
none the less, a very sweet consciousness
to sit there quietly, close by her side, and
he half fancied it was also pleasure to
her. During the sermon he was acutely
aware of her, and of every slightest movement
that she had made in shifting her
position, or moving her feet upon the footstool.
And once, only once, he heard her
breathe a little sigh, the sound of which
stirred him to tenderness.</p>

<p>After the sermon the hymn was given
out, and it proved to be the one that had
been sung on the occasion of his first
coming here. When the young girl rose
with the open book in her hand, she observed
that he had no book, and with a
movement at once frank and timid she
offered him hers, glancing up at him as she
did so. He shook his head, declining to
deprive her of it, but at the same time he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
caught hold of its extreme corner nearest
him and continued to hold it so, until she
saw his meaning, and took hold of the
opposite corner. Then in a carefully
modulated and sympathetic voice, which
had great sweetness and charm without
remarkable power, he began to sing. Admiring
women had been touched by his
voice before to-day, and it was no wonder
if it touched with power the woman standing
at his side. He hoped it did, at least,
but he could divine nothing, as her little
shabby thumb supported the book unwaveringly
until the hymn was ended.</p>

<p>Walking homeward that day, Randall
looked his present condition in the face
more boldly and honestly than he had ever
done before, and the result of it was that
he owned that he was in love.</p>

<p>Having made this acknowledgment to
himself, that he was really in love, he
faced the possible consequences squarely
also, and he came to the conclusion that
his only safety was in flight. As for marrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
a street singer, whom he had seen
insulted by a common rough, and who had
a voice as rasping to him as a peacock’s, he
might be more or less of a fool in his love
of having his own way, but he was not
such a fool as that!</p>

<p>The contradicting facts, that she was as
beautiful as a dream, and had, as he believed,
a nature both exalted and refined—did
not by any means seem to him a sufficient
compensation, and he made up his
mind to go abroad for several months,
and to come back with this little episode
quite eradicated from his mind.</p>

<p>He carried out his plan so far as the
trip was concerned, and even as to its
results he felt that he had been fairly
successful. Certainly the absurdity of
having fallen in love with a street singer
with an abominable voice was sufficiently
clear to him, and change of scene
and absence had done their work in weakening
the spell which this girl had laid
upon him. In spite of all this, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
he was not sufficiently self-secure to run
any risks. He would not have dared to go
to church, and he had made up his mind
to look out for new lodgings immediately,
and until these should be secured, not to
go to the front windows.</p>

<p>These resolutions he religiously kept.
He had taken no vow, however, not to
look toward the opposite house in going
up and down the street, and this he always
did, half hoping and half fearing to see
that lovely vision in rose-color, who still
remained the most beautiful picture in the
world to his mind. He never caught a
glimpse of her, however, and so far had
seen and heard nothing of the street singers,
a thing which, of course, might be
accounted for by the fact that the cool
weather of autumn had set in, and there
was no chance of drawing a crowd in the
streets to listen to singing of that sort.</p>

<p>During his trip abroad Randall had given
himself a perfect feast of music. Convinced
more strongly than ever that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
“love’s young dream” was not for him,
he was determined to make the most of the
next best thing, and to fill his soul with
music. To lose the opportunities which
Europe offered him for this had been his
greatest regret in coming home, and after
indulgence in the very richest forms of
musical delight he felt more or less impatient
of the concerts and recitals of
which he read in the columns of the home
newspapers.</p>

<p>One afternoon at his club, he heard some
men discussing a concert which was to take
place that evening, and they suggested to
him to go. It seemed that Mensenn, a
well-known manager, had discovered a
wonderful new voice, possessed by a young
girl living in the city. Only the name of
Mensenn would have drawn Randall into
a thing like this, and even with that important
recommendation of the new singer
he felt dubious and half-reluctant, but that
evening, having nothing better to do, and
having within him a great thirst for music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
he went to the great concert hall to see
what he could do, to satisfy it.</p>

<p>It was rather a surprise to him that
Mensenn had ventured on the biggest hall
in the city for the launching of this <i>débutante</i>
and yet he reflected that Mensenn
was a man who generally knew what he
was about.</p>

<p>Randall was a somewhat erratic and
unaccountable fellow, careful and economical
about money on certain lines, and recklessly
prodigal in others. Where the indulgence
of his love for music was concerned,
he never counted it, and this evening,
after reading the programme and seeing
several favorites among the selections,
he felt inclined to do his very utmost to
get pleasure out of this concert by hearing
it under the best conditions that he
could secure. The chief of these was
either sympathetic companionship, or solitude,
and as he could not command the
first, he would the latter, so he got a
small curtained box in good sight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
sound of the stage, and took his place in
it alone.</p>

<p>The concert opened with a very good
performance of violin and violoncello, with
piano accompaniment. The players were
not great artists, but Randall got enough
out of it to stir the deep, emotional feelings
within, that made him simply yearn and
hunger for more—more music and
sweeter, more life and fuller! The next
performance was to introduce the new
singer, Miss Bianca May.</p>

<p>He sat quite screened from view behind
his curtain, and waited with mingled hope
and doubting for her to come out. And
now she appeared, Mensenn leading her.
She was tall, she was dressed in white,
she was supremely beautiful. His heart
gave a great leap; the blood seemed to surge
forward in his veins, and then to rush back
in a way that gave him a sense of suffocation.
She was walking forward with a
step and a carriage that he recognized.
She was looking around the house with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
great, pure, innocent and timid eyes that
he had looked into before! She was his
opposite neighbor—Tommy’s little mistress!</p>

<p>Her beauty was positively enthralling,
but oh, her voice! At the thought of that,
he turned cold with dread, and then hot
with angry protest. What <i>did</i> Mensenn
mean? How <i>could</i> he let her adorn her
loveliness like this, to be led as a victim
to the sacrifice? He knew the character
of the audience assembled, and he knew
that they were not people to be inveigled
into the toleration of such a voice by mere
beauty. The very fact that she had such
a beautiful and correct method would make
the thing all the more an insult to their intelligence.
He was almost beside himself
with anger and mortification. He longed
passionately to rush upon the stage and drag
her away, and to hide her beautiful, unconscious
face against his heart, before she
had come to feel the contempt and indignation
which the audience, now spellbound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> 
by her beauty, would very soon have
ready for her.</p>

<p>Across the wild confusion of these
frantic, angry thoughts a sound fell, a
sound so sweet, so powerful, so exquisite,
that it was like the voice of peace, speaking
with a strong, commanding influence
to his soul. It was a voice that satisfied,
for the first time in his life, the
utmost ideal of Randall’s soul! Not only
was it the perfect method that he knew,
but the voice, itself, was so gloriously
exquisite, so fine, so clear, so passionately
sweet, that his soul was wrapt in ecstacy.
It was almost too cruelly sweet. Randall
shuddered, and, when the song ended, he
dropped his face in his hands and gave a
sort of sob.</p>

<p>Then there came from the audience an
absolute storm of applause. So tempestuous
and excited was it, that the girl
was evidently divided between pleasure
and fright, and when Mensenn came to
her and led her from the stage, she was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
visibly shaken that she could not, at once,
respond to the encore. It seemed to
Randall cruel—it made him madly indignant
that they should make this demand
upon her, and while the clapping and calling
was at its height, he left his box, and
made his way into the street.</p>

<p>For an hour or more he walked about
trying to secure some degree of calmness,
and to solve this inscrutable mystery.
What was the secret of this miraculous
change of voice? Had it all been a clever
imitation of inferiority and discordant
sound that she had practiced behind her
mask? How could it be possible to so
disguise the voice of a lark or of an
angel such as this? And what could have
been the object? Whatever it was, the
creature who had long ago won his love,
and who had now by the possession of this
voice deepened that love to adoration, was
the woman he must have for his wife,
if work of man and prayers to heaven
could accomplish it! The fact that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
had been a masked street singer, the
uncertain quantity of her relation toward
the man who had played with her in that
character,—all these things vanished, and
Randall was possessed by the headlong
wish, which dominated everything else, of
getting access to her immediately, and
begging her to become his wife.</p>

<p>He made his way back at last to the
concert hall, and found the audience just
dispersing. He had not wished to hear
her sing again; he felt that it would be
more than he could bear, but he had a
definite purpose in view as he made his
way to the rear of the stage. Here he
met several men whom he knew, coming
away.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, my boy!” said one of
these. “Old Mensenn is immovable. He
not only will not introduce us, but he
refuses, for the present, to answer any
questions. Perhaps he’s wise, for after
such an ovation as this, if she showed up,
she’d run the risk of being eaten alive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
The women are as mad over her as the
men.” Randall hurried on, however, and
catching sight of the well-known face of
old Mensenn, approached him with a certain
confidence. The man had known
him long, and, as Randall hoped, in a way
that had made him trust him. Every
effort which he made was perfectly useless,
however. It was evident that no
exception to his decision was to be made.</p>

<p>Randall was turning away half-resentfully
when a man, small and unremarkable
in appearance, came from a long,
dark passage and, seeing him, stopped a
second, and then, as if recognizing him,
approached rapidly and said:</p>

<p>“You do not know me, but you rendered
me and mine a service once, which I
can never forget. You are the man who
punished the brute who offered an insult
to the being dearest to me in the world.
I saw you from behind my mask, and have
often wished that I could thank you properly
for what you did. Will you call to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
see me to-morrow afternoon at four, and
let me introduce you to my daughter that
she may thank you, too?” And while
Randall stood astonished and delighted, the
man gave the address of the house opposite
his own, and then walked away.</p>

<p>Randall, on his way home, felt, in spite
of his joy at this stroke of fortune, as puzzled
and confused in mind as ever. It
was an untold relief to learn that the man
with whom the woman he loved had sung
in the public streets was her father, but
oh, how could he have let her do it?
What sort of a father could he be? And
yet his somewhat pathetic face had beamed
with tenderness during the few seconds
in which he had spoken to him. Well,
one great burden had been rolled away
from his heart by the discovery of this
relationship between the street singer and
her companion; another had gone with
the discovery that that awful sound of discord
was not her natural voice; and the
one that still remained, the fact that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
had been a masked street singer, lay heavy
on his heart still, but contrasted with the
love he had for this woman, that burden
he was more than ready to carry.</p>

<p>The next afternoon at precisely four, he
rang at the door of the opposite house, and
asked for Mr. May. The servant led him
up several flights of stairs to the very top
of the house, and then along a dark passage
leading to the back building, and here
she knocked at a door, and then turned
and left him. A man’s voice called “Come
in!” and Randall opened the door and saw
his new acquaintance sitting at a table
writing, and at his side his old acquaintance
seated on a low chair engaged in stroking
Tommy, who was greatly grown. He
did not see the kitten at first, because of
the fact that the young girl was dressed in
deep, intense black, which swathed her to
her throat and wrists. It made the brilliant
loveliness of her face, however, all
the more startling, as she rose to her feet,
still holding Tommy, and recognized him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
with her usual tribute of a rosy blush.
His appearance was evidently a surprise
to her, though it soon became evident
that her father had prepared her for the
reception of a stranger, and had told her to
what cause the visit was due.</p>

<p>The father, himself, a somewhat feeble
and timid man, explained that they were
in the shadow of a recent bereavement,
his wife, and the girl’s mother, having died
only a month or so ago. He alluded to it
in a low and sorrowful voice, and ended
with the words:</p>

<p>“You can understand, therefore, all the
more, why I should have wished for the
opportunity of thanking you for resenting
the affront that was offered to her, by that
brute, when she was exposing herself, for
the sake of our child, to the dangers which
such a position made inevitable. It was all
that our dear daughter might be nurtured
in refined and wholesome conditions, for
the preservation of her health and her innocence,
and the development of her voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
which has fulfilled, at last, all our hopes
concerning it, when the dear mother, who
so passionately loved her has passed beyond
the knowledge of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say so, Father,” said the young
girl, gently. “I felt her very near to me,
last night. It was that thought which kept
me up and enabled me to sing my best.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, she drew a little nearer to
him, and putting Tommy on the floor, she
took her father’s hand in hers and held it,
while he talked to their visitor, and told his
story, in a simple, frank, unworldly way
that very soon put Randall in possession
of the whole situation. It was made very
clear to him that the mother had been the
master spirit of this trio, and that this
mild and ineffectual little man was very
helpless without her. His lack of worldly
prudence showed plainly enough in the
fact that he took this stranger so fully into
his confidence on the sole ground that
he had once defended his dead wife from
an insult. The girl, herself, too, seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
to find nothing strange in the situation, as
she sat by and listened to her father’s
recital of his wife’s labor of love and
sacrifices.</p>

<p>She had once possessed a superb voice,
herself, it seemed, and had received the
most perfect and thorough training in a
great European <i>conservatoire</i>, being herself
an Italian, but before she had sung in
public at all, a severe attack of throat trouble
had ruined her voice forever, and she
had come to America to give lessons, and
in a southern town had met and married
her husband. Then had begun a long life
of vicissitudes of various kinds, culminating
in the street-singing performances, a
necessity to which they had been reduced,
at last, by positive want. In this way she
had eked out the little that she could make
by taking pupils at a small price, and by
the little jobs of writing and bookkeeping
which the man himself could get, until the
time should be ripe for her daughter’s
<i>début</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>All this was told to Randall with the utmost
simplicity, and Bianca, herself, sitting
by, seemed pleased that he should know it.
When at last he rose to go, it was like the
parting of friends, and he asked and received
permission to come again. He
longed almost intolerably to ask her now,
to-day, to be his wife, and he chafed under
the necessity of delay.</p>

<p>And the delay, in point of fact, was not
very long. When hearts are young and
trusting, why should it be? And Bianca
had had an instinct of blind trust in him
from the first. He got Mensenn to say a
good word for him; he cultivated the
father and took pains to make him acquainted
with the details of his life, position
and circumstances; and then, at last, he felt
that he had only Bianca’s consent to win.</p>

<p>How would she answer him? How
did she feel toward him? He asked himself
these questions with agitated hope and
fear. Her very friendliness and frankness
half frightened him at times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>One afternoon when he went to call, as
he did almost daily now, he found Bianca in
the little sitting-room alone. It was the first
time it had happened so, and she explained
her father’s absence, and that he might be
in at any moment. The situation was a
little constrained for her, and Randall saw
it, and to reassure her he asked her to sing.
She had done this frequently before, but
always with her father to play her accompaniments.
He volunteered to do this
now, himself, and sitting down to the
piano he struck the opening chords of the
song he had first heard her sing. The
song which had been the consummation
of her revelation to him. She began to
sing it. They were alone together. The
song was more than speech. He turned
his head and looked upward at her. His
look agitated her, and her voice faltered.
At this he smiled, and the voice grew more
unsteady. Then suddenly he stopped
playing, and without the support of the
accompaniment, she broke down utterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>But the hands that were lifted from the
keys suddenly took both of hers in an imperious
grasp. The gaze that she tried
desperately to avoid, compelled her to
look at him, and after the confession of
that look she knew no more, but that she
was in his arms, and was glad and satisfied.</p>

<p class="ph3">The Story of an Old Soul</p>
</div>

<p>All things considered, it was not strange
that Clement Rhodes should have looked
back upon his one year of marriage as a
mere episode in his experience. His had
been a life of more or less excited and
turbulent episodes, all through, and perhaps
that one—his marriage with an ignorant
and pretty school-girl—was now among
the vaguest of all the emotional impressions
which were stamped upon his brain.</p>

<p>He had been nearer to fifty than forty,
and a conventional type of old beau,
when he had chanced to be thrown familiarly
into the society of this young girl.
Young girls were somewhat rare in his
experience, for the reason that all such
who had any one to look out for them,
were protected from the dangers of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
more than a very casual acquaintance
with him. He was permitted to take
them in to dinner, to dance with them, or
to pay them any passing attention when
they were fully chaperoned, but there the
line was drawn.</p>

<p>It was an unusual experience for him,
therefore, when, during a visit to some
friends in the country, he found himself
frequently <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a girl of eighteen,
who had as little idea of protecting
herself from a man like him, as her hostess
had of protecting her. The fact was that
this hostess had frankly declared to him
her wish that he should marry this girl,
saying that she was both too poor and too
pretty to look out for herself.</p>

<p>The idea, when first presented to
Rhodes, seemed absurd in the extreme,
for he was poor also, and lived in a hand-to-mouth
fashion, which he had known
better than to ask any woman to share.
He had never entertained the possibility of
marrying any but a rich woman, and now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
as he had grown older, and his shiftless
habits were more fixed upon him, he had
begun to realize that his chance of doing
this was very small. The idea of marrying
a penniless girl, however, was more preposterous
still, and it was therefore a great
surprise to him when he found himself
committed to this marriage.</p>

<p>It had come about simply enough. He
was a thoroughly initiated old flirt, and
when he had tried some of his wiles upon
this <i>ingénue</i>, and she had responded by an
innocent revelation of her love for him,
there proved to be one note in him sufficiently
finely attuned to compel him to act
honorably by this young girl who had
trusted him. Without stopping to consider
how it would hamper him for the
future, he married her, and took her to as
comfortable a little set of rooms as he
could manage to secure.</p>

<p>He was in love with her, of course.
Falling in love was one of the most facile
of feats to Rhodes, and falling out was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
about as easy. Heretofore, dancers and
comic-opera singers had been the most
frequent objects of his worn-out affections,
and the present contrast to all this had
undoubtedly something piquant in it.</p>

<p>After a few months, however, the prosaic
demands of the monotonous home
life in the little suburban roost, where his
friends never came, grew very wearing,
particularly as his wife was delicate,
and indisposed to join him in his trips to
the theatres and concert-halls, which had
become a confirmed habit of his life. She
did not wish to confine him at home, however,
and she insisted that he should go
without her, so that gradually he found
himself slipping back into his bachelor
ways.</p>

<p>It was very welcome to Rhodes about
this time to have any means of drowning
care, for he was badgered about debts and
expenses, finding it more than he could do
to keep going even that poor establishment.
He had a desultory occupation as an insurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
agent, by which he picked up a little
money now and then; but younger and
more industrious men were fast pushing
him aside, and his income diminished as
his expenses increased.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, even to his consciousness,
just as well that his young wife died.
It would perhaps have been better if the
baby had died with her, and he could so
have buried out of sight all reminder of
that strange and incongruous episode in his
life.</p>

<p>But the baby, a tiny girl, did not
die. She struggled through teething, and
whooping cough, and measles, and many
other such attacks, in the midst of neglect,
cold, heat, hunger, and pain, and lived on,
growing into an almost preternaturally
serious, wise, and thoughtful child.</p>

<p>There is a theory of which this father
and child might be taken as striking examples.
It is to the effect that every created
soul has the same period of human life to
compass, and that it exists, in successive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
human incarnations, until that period is
accomplished. Sometimes, but an hour or
a minute may be needed to make up the
exact sum, but the re-incarnation must necessarily
be, even if for no longer a time
than that. This theory, we are told,
accounts for the phenomena of youth in
age, and age in youth, which we so often
see; in other words, it explains why a very
aged person is often silly and childish, and
a young child wise and matured in mind.
When this occurs (so the theory goes) the
old person is in his or her first incarnation—is,
in fact, a young soul—while the
child may be in his or her last incarnation,
an old soul almost ready to be liberated
from humanity and admitted to the higher
life.</p>

<p>Whether there be truth in this theory,
or not, certain it is that Clem Rhodes had
the attributes of a young soul, ignorant in
mind and shallow in feeling, while his
little daughter (whom her fond mother had
named Clementina) had the mental force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
and depth of feeling which might well seem
to belong to an old soul.</p>

<p>The strangest part of it was the way in
which they both seemed to realize the
truth about themselves. Although Clementina
was now but six years old, and her
father was well over fifty, there could be
no question as to which of them was the
guiding, ruling, dominating spirit. Her
mind was as marked for its orderliness as
her father’s was for the absence of that
trait. Quite from within, she had evolved
a sentiment of horror for debt and loose
dealing of every kind, and she would sit in
judgment on her father for such practices
in a way, which, however strange, he never
thought of resenting. In some way never
fully accounted for, she had formed the
habit of calling him “Clem,” or “Boy,”
instead of “Papa.”</p>

<p>Clementina was by no means beautiful—a
small, thin, pale child, with enormous
dark eyes, which were so thoughtful and
steady in their expression that most people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
who looked at her, ever so casually,
found their attention caught and fixed,
and an impression of wonder conveyed to
them.</p>

<p>The child’s life was almost absolutely
lonely, in spite of the fact that she had
found out and entered herself as a pupil at
a small free school in the neighborhood;
for she kept apart from everyone; and
although she made extraordinary progress
in her lessons, she made no friends. It
was her father’s habit to be absent all day,
so she prepared her little mid-day meal, and
partook of it alone.</p>

<p>By this time Rhodes’s flagging energies
and accumulating years had reduced him
to such poverty, that his former rather
comfortable set of rooms was now diminished
to one, and in this he and the child
slept, cooked, ate their meals, and lived.
They had two folding-beds, which were
closed up in the daytime, and a folding-table,
which was then opened. At night,
the beds were lowered into the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
space of the room, and the table folded
back against the wall.</p>

<p>Rhodes always took his breakfast and
late dinner with the child, these meals
being cooked and served by her with very
little help from him. She also did the
marketing, and kept the accounts, setting
down all her figures neatly and accurately,
but getting his help in adding up the
columns.</p>

<p>The father, of course, had a life of his
own, which was as apart from that of the
child, as her long, lonely hours were apart
from his. He had dropped out of society,
almost entirely, and he frequented the theatres
more than ever. Occasionally, he took
the child with him; but although she never
so far relaxed her dignity as to fall asleep,
she seemed to get but little pleasure out of
it, and her solemn air and deeply thoughtful
expression so grated on him, that he
was glad that she did not oftener express
a wish to go.</p>

<p>Clementina was a strangely wakeful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
child, and he had never yet been able to
steal into the room, no matter at what
hour of the night, or with what degree of
stealth, that she had not heard him.</p>

<p>“That you, Boy?” she would say, her
voice sounding strangely conscious in the
stillness and darkness. Then, invariably,
she would sit up in her little bed, and
strike a match and light the candle placed
beside her. Then, when at her command
he would come to kiss her good-night, she
would give him that swift, searching look,
which he always knew was coming, and
then, if satisfied, she would lie down and
go quietly to sleep.</p>

<p>As a general thing, it happened that she
was satisfied, but there had been times
when it was otherwise, and those occasions
Rhodes remembered with such distinct unpleasantness,
that they served him as valuable
warnings. She had never uttered
any rebuke in words, but the deep, penetrating
condemnation of her concentrated
gaze had made him feel, that for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
moment his life was turned inside out to
her, and that she saw him as he was.</p>

<p>This was all the more painful to him,
because of the fact that the child seemed
to be possessed of an inherent respect for
him. She advised, and even censured him
at times, it is true, but always Rhodes had
a sense of being deferred to, and it was a
grateful feeling to the heart of such a poor
devil as he.</p>

<p>Clementina never complained of solitude,
and, as a rule, she seemed to prefer
these lonely evenings, spent in studying
her lessons, tidying things up, sewing on
buttons, cleaning spots from her father’s
clothes, and doing odd jobs of mending, to
the alternative of going to the theatre.
Occasionally, however, she would announce
that she was going with him, and
at such times he never objected.</p>

<p>Rhodes had now been a widower for
more than six years, and these years had
been a tolerably fair copy of his bachelor
days, except that he now made his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
among people of a somewhat lower grade
than formerly; for they were almost exclusively
third-rate actresses, dancers, concert-singers,
etc. It was a life through which
he would quickly have sunk very low,
but for one thing—the influence of
Clementina. She never preached goodness
to him, nor talked religion (poor
child, she had been taught little enough of
either!), and yet she continually held him
up to his better self, and dragged him
back to it when he fell away.</p>

<p>About this time there appeared a celebrated
dancer, whose services were engaged
for the entire season at the Summer-Garden
concerts, and poor old Clem, for
the fortieth time, imagined that the <i>grande
passion</i> of his life had come upon him.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Tarara was not so far
removed from first youth as he, but
still she was by no means young. Her
matured charms, however, were positively
deadly to the troops of boys who attended
these concerts, and she soon found herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
not only a financial, but a popular success.
She was fond of boys, and her intercourse
with them was far less harmful to them
than it might have been. She had a great
deal of rollicking fun in her, and she could
always sing better and kick higher, when
she was spurred on by the enthusiastic
clapping and shouting of her young admirers.
With the single exception of
Rhodes, they were all many years her
junior.</p>

<p>And if she was fond of the boys, she
was also fond of Rhodes, for the very reason
that he was a foil for them. Life was
behind him, as it was behind her, and she
often found his point of view congenial,
after too much of the boyish element.</p>

<p>So Rhodes was admitted to the privilege
of visiting her at her own rooms, which
the boys were not, and his battered old
heart was in the seventh heaven of delight.</p>

<p>The people whom he met at the Tarara’s
rooms were of a sort with herself, and all of
them were so easy-going and inconsequent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
that it was a pleasant reaction from the
rather constraining ideal held up to him
by his child.</p>

<p>Poor old Clem! He had been a dreamer
all his life—of the earth, earthy, though
his dreams had been—and shifting and
unstable as they were in character. The
favor which the Tarara showed him now
had led him into dreams of a marriage with
her, which would establish him for life in
the green-room and lime-light atmosphere
which he loved, and would give him, not
only the Tarara herself, with whom he believed
he was madly in love, but also all
the other things which he desired in life.
In the pursuance of these hopes, he had
resolutely concealed from her the knowledge
of the fact that he had a child, believing
that it would be quite fatal to his
cause.</p>

<p>In the evenings, when work was over,
and the tiny room in perfect order, Clementina
would sit alone and think. Of
what did she think there in her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
chair, so neat and self-collected, with her
eyes fixed on space, or else occasionally
turned upward to the stars, of which she
could see a small bright patch out of
her little window? Her experience in
this human existence had been so meagre,
the avenues of knowledge so limited, that
it would almost seem reasonable to suppose
that she drew upon former experiences
in some other incarnation, for the
material of that deep thinking and wise
doing, which continually occupied her.</p>

<p>One evening, it happened that Clem
became conscious of an unusually penetrating
and scrutinizing look fixed upon
him by this austere child of his, and he
imagined that it was in some occult way
the result of that investigation, which
caused her to announce, suddenly,</p>

<p>“I’m going with you this evening,
Clem.”</p>

<p>“Where?” he said, surprised.</p>

<p>“Wherever you are going.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to the concert,” he said; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
then added, dissuadingly, “You wouldn’t
like it.”</p>

<p>“But I’m going,” she answered, putting
away her dusting-cloth, after having made
the room as neat as usual.</p>

<p>He felt a certain protest and anxiety,
but he never resisted her, and so a little
later they were taking their places in front
of the lowered curtain. The prices at
these concerts were very small, and there
was always a good attendance, but the
child and her father being early, had secured
good seats.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Clem was feeling
rather uncomfortable this evening. He
was not so free to indulge his admiration
for the inimitable Tarara with this discordant
element beside him—and what
if his secret should be discovered? He
had, moreover, the strongest feeling that
Clementina’s eyes invariably saw through
the surface of things into their souls. He
was afraid for her to see the Tarara, and
still more afraid for the Tarara to see her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
though, of course, if this should happen,
he need not own the relationship between
them.</p>

<p>Clem now felt a shrinking from the
thought of Clementina’s comments on the
Tarara, and he didn’t like the idea of
the dancer appearing before the child in
her tinsel and tights. She always came
out arrayed thus for at least one dance,
though she generally changed her costume
several times during the evening.</p>

<p>As Rhodes took a furtive look at the
figure beside him, his sense of discomfiture
increased.</p>

<p>She was startlingly pale, and so slim and
delicate, that he was not surprised that the
people about them looked at her with a
certain pity, of which, it was evident, she
took no account. Her odd garments and
queer hat also marked her out for special
notice; and when, taken in connection
with all the rest, one noted the strange
penetrating gaze of her immense dark
eyes, it was not surprising, perhaps, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
Rhodes felt uncomfortable and half irritated
at the position in which he found
himself.</p>

<p>That fixed, absorbed look on the child’s
face did not change when the performance
began. It was a merry chorus which
made the audience laugh and beat time,
but Clementina was unmoved. Then two
men came out and danced a clog-dance,
during which her look remained the same—as
if, somehow, she saw through and
beyond it all.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of distinct apprehension
that Rhodes now saw Mademoiselle
Tarara make her appearance. She
was dressed in an Italian peasant costume,
but the skirts were shorter and the bodice
lower than necessity required. He looked
at the child to see if her countenance expressed
any disapproval. To his great surprise,
he saw that the little pale face had
softened into a look of pleasure, as if she
recognized something that she liked.</p>

<p>The Tarara, meanwhile, was posed, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
her hands on her hips, waiting for her cue
from the orchestra.</p>

<p>As she stood thus, she looked around the
house with an expression of friendly good-will
on her face—the true index of a
quality in her which accounted largely for
her popularity. Then she began to sing.</p>

<p>It was a ballad of the “homely pathetic”
order, such as never fails to go to the
hearts of an audience, with its allusions to
mother, wife, child, home, etc., and the
Tarara sang it with great feeling.</p>

<p>Rhodes, watching that strange child of
his, whom he always felt to be a mystery
beyond his ken, saw now a look of deep
content and pleasure settle on her face, and
some very rare tear-drops rise to her eyes.</p>

<p>When the song had ended, she turned
to him and said, abruptly:</p>

<p>“I love that lady.”</p>

<p>A strange sense of joy throbbed through
the man’s heart at these words. They
were something more than a surprise.</p>

<p>“She is good and kind,” said Clementina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
with the same tone of conviction.
“I wish she would come back.”</p>

<p>Rhodes, for his part, rather dreaded that
return, for fear the sweet impression might
be destroyed. But when she afterward
appeared as a smart hussar, and sang a barrack
song, and then as a <i>vivandière</i> and
gurgled her song from over a tin canteen,
the impression which she had made upon
the child was evidently not disturbed.</p>

<p>It was noticeable, however, that the
Tarara was the only one of the performers
who had found favor with Clementina.
The others either bored her, or roused a
feeling of disapproval, which that strong
little face well knew how to express.</p>

<p>The last appearance of the Tarara was
in a ballet costume, and as she floated out
on the stage and pirouetted up to the footlights,
Rhodes glanced with real timidity at
the child. He dreaded the effect of the
bare limbs and painted face upon this
austere judge. But Clementina’s eyes
were fixed with a look of unmixed pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
upon the dancer, who, as Clem now
saw to his amazement, caught and returned
her gaze.</p>

<p>It was for a second only, but there could
be no doubt of it, and the child saw it, also,
for she flushed with happiness and said,
under her breath:</p>

<p>“Oh, the sweet lady!”</p>

<p>With the same look of confidence and
content, she followed every movement until
the dance was ended.</p>

<p>The Tarara, after that one glance, did
not again look at the child, but as she
skimmed and bounded about the stage,
going through all the peculiarly imbecile
motions of the modern ballet dance, as she
toyed with her tarletan skirts and sidled
diagonally on her poor blunted toes, threw
her body backward and waved her arms,
then smirked and grimaced at the applause
that burst from the house, the child’s gaze
grew more and more delighted, until it
deepened into a look of burning love.</p>

<p>This gaze, also, the dancer caught as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
was leaving the stage, and she not only
caught, but returned it. Rhodes began to
feel deeply alarmed for his secret, but the
reflection, that she could not possibly know
that the child was his, partly reassured
him.</p>

<p>The Tarara vanished in a storm of applause.
She had outdone herself to-night,
and the audience sent up a vociferous
encore.</p>

<p>“Oh, is she coming back? Is she
coming back?” asked Clementina, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Her father, greatly wondering, assured
her that the dancer would return.</p>

<p>But as the applause rose, subsided, then
swelled again, and no Tarara appeared, he
found that he had spoken too quickly. It
became evident that the favorite refused
to respond to the encore, and now, as four
couples in the costumes of Bowery toughs
swaggered out on the stage, the house grew
quiet and turned its attention to the new
performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>But Clementina would not look at
them. Instead, she turned to her father
and said, in a voice of emphatic command:</p>

<p>“Take me to see that lady.”</p>

<p>Rhodes was accustomed to obey the
mandates of this imperious child, but for
once he resisted her.</p>

<p>“I cannot,” he said. “She is in her
room. She is tired. People are not
allowed to go to her private room.”</p>

<p>“But I am going,” said Clementina, in a
tone in which, in all his experience, he had
never known her to utter a fiat that was
unfulfilled. As she spoke she rose from
her place and took her father’s hand,
urging him insistently to go. Seeing that
they were being observed by those about
them, Rhodes yielded unwillingly, and
when they were without in the vestibule
of the theatre, she spoke again, in the
same tone:</p>

<p>“I am going to see that lady,” she said.
“If you do not take me, I will go without
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>He was so accustomed to seeing her
perform resolutely whatever she undertook—this
strange, determined child of
his—that he felt that he could not thwart
her will, and so he began, in a helpless,
entreating fashion, to try to alter it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Clementina, please don’t go!” he
said. “Come home with me—please do!
I’ll do anything you want if you’ll only
come home with me now.”</p>

<p>“Not until I have seen that lady,” said
the child, an expression of indomitable
purpose making her little face look strangely
old.</p>

<p>Poor Clem was almost in tears. He
felt that he had not the power to resist
her, and he felt, at the same time, that if
she carried her point his case was lost
with the Tarara. He had hoped to win
her consent to marry him, and he had
meant to conceal the child’s existence
until the marriage should be over, and then
to confess it, throwing himself upon her
mercy, and offering to put the child in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
some school or asylum where she should
be kindly treated and yet be out of the
way.</p>

<p>But if Clementina persisted, now, all
would be lost. He resolved upon a subterfuge
and a lie. The child’s purpose
must be frustrated at all costs.</p>

<p>“If you will come with me now,” he
said, “I will take you to see her to-morrow.
Come, Clementina, please.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow will not do,” the child
began, in that same tone of resolution,
but at this instant a boy came up to them,
and delivered a message to Clem. This
message was a summons to him to come
at once to the Tarara’s room, and to bring
the child.</p>

<p>With a last effort at resistance he was
beginning to frame an excuse, when, in
the very midst of his speech, Clementina
said, decisively, speaking to the boy:</p>

<p>“I am coming. Show me the way,”
and the poor old father was scarcely surprised
when he found the messenger ignoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
him entirely, and obeying the words
of the child.</p>

<p>She had already started after him, and
Clem could only follow them, in feeble
wretchedness and disappointment.</p>

<p>The boy led the way through various
dusty and dimly-lighted passages, and presently
paused before a door at which he
rapped sharply, and then walked away.</p>

<p>A voice said: “Come in!”</p>

<p>Clementina turned the knob, and entered,
her father following, and taking
care to close the door behind him.</p>

<p>Instead of finding the popular dancer
flung in picturesque abandonment on the
lounge, drinking iced champagne or smoking
a cigarette (which was what Rhodes
expected) he saw her seated before her
dressing-table, on which were scattered a
disorderly collection of wigs, masks, powder-puffs,
curling-irons, rouge-pots, and various
other paraphernalia of her profession. Her
elbows were crushing some artificial flowers,
as she sat with her chin in her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
and her gaze fixed solemnly upon her own
reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>As she turned toward them, the child
ran forward and flung her arms around
the dancer’s bare neck, lifting her face to
be kissed.</p>

<p>The Tarara gave a little cry, and sprang
to her feet, and then, the next instant,
crouched down again, and made a motion
as if she would cover, with her short tarletan
skirts, the exposure of plump legs
cased in thin flesh-colored tights. What
had come over her? Those shapely limbs
were usually her pride. When had she felt
any sense of modesty about them before?</p>

<p>But the child was not looking at them.
Neither did she look at the false hair, the
rouge, the powder, the painted eyebrows,
and <i>bistré</i> lids. She had clasped her arms
around the dancer’s neck again, and was
looking straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>The feeling which came to the Tarara
as she met that look was that one creature
saw her soul, at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>“I love you. You are kind, and sweet,
and good,” the child said, softly, still regarding
her with that deep, penetrating gaze,
and with intense conviction in her tone.</p>

<p>The Tarara’s painted face began to
quiver, and great tear-drops brimmed her
eyes, as she caught the little creature to
her, crushing to irremediable flatness her
diaphanous tarletan skirts. She strained
the small creature to her breast a moment,
and then seated her on her lap. She had
caught up a rich plush cape from a chair,
and had thrown it over the tights and dancing-shoes.</p>

<p>Rhodes, meanwhile, stood looking on,
in a state of stupefaction. They had
both forgotten him, as they clung to each
other, with close kisses and embraces.</p>

<p>A deep emotion was evident in both of
them, but its character was different. The
woman was stirred to a passionate excitement;
her breaths came in deep, catching
sobs; her face worked with a nervous
strain; and her cheeks flushed hotly under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
their rouge. The child, on the other
hand, was deeply calm and grave. She
lay with utter contentment in that bedizened
creature’s arms, and looked up at her
as trustingly and unquestioningly as
though she had been a Madonna. This
long, deep, concentrated look was undisturbed,
as she said with a wondering
seriousness:</p>

<p>“Are you my mother?”</p>

<p>“No, darling, no,” the dancer said,
bending above her with a mother’s tenderness,
while the tears ran down her cheeks,
making a pitiable daub of black and white
and red there.</p>

<p>“My mother died,” the child went on,
looking only at the gentle eyes of the
woman, and speaking in a grave and placid
tone.</p>

<p>“And my little baby died,” the dancer
said. “She would have been as old as
you. She died before she ever knew her
mother’s face, and my heart has been
empty, ever since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>“I love you,” said the child.</p>

<p>The strong, spasmodic movement with
which the dancer crushed her to her heart,
as she said these words, must have been
physically painful, but if it was, the child
gave no sign, except a radiant smile of joy.
There was a look of almost holy calm
upon the little pallid face. She put up
one small hand, and patted lovingly the
smeared face that bent above her.</p>

<p>“You are good,” she said.</p>

<p>“Am I, darling? Oh, I should like to
be! If my little baby had lived perhaps
I should have been, though everybody has
been bad to me. No one has ever loved
me, as you do, before.”</p>

<p>“Your little child loves you,” was the
quiet answer, still with that look and tone
of knowledge.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think she does, and that
I will some time have her again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the child, with a certainty
that seemed to make doubt unreasonable.
Then looking around, as if in sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
recollection, she said, “Clem—Boy—come
here.”</p>

<p>At these words a lingering hope sprang
up in Rhodes’s heart. This strange mode
of addressing him might enable him to
keep his secret still. If he could only get
the child away now, and to-morrow
contrive some way of accounting for her!
With this end in view he came forward,
the child turning on him, as he did so,
the fond, penetrating look he knew so
well.</p>

<p>The dancer glanced quickly from one
to the other, but it was the child she questioned,
and not the man.</p>

<p>“Is he your father?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Clementina. “My mother
died when I was very little. He has been
so good to me.”</p>

<p>But what was the matter with Clementina’s
voice, and why was her breath suddenly
so short and difficult? Rhodes was
conscious of this, even in that moment
when he realized that his secret was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
revealed, and his hopes of the Tarara
blasted. She was conscious of it, too,
and her face took on a sudden look of
terror.</p>

<p>Rhodes dropped upon his knees beside
the two, who still clung to one another in
that close embrace. Over the child’s
drooped head the man and the woman exchanged
a quick, scared look. Then both
looked at the child.</p>

<p>The gaze that answered their excited
ones was so calm, so strong, so full of
knowledge and assured content, that outwardly,
at least, they were quieted. One
thin, little arm lay still around the dancer’s
neck, and with evident effort she lifted the
other and laid it around the neck of her
frightened, childish old father.</p>

<p>Almost instantly it fell back heavily.
There was a little twitch of the thin body,
a stifled breath, one more sweet glance
of love, and the child lay dead between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>In a moment all was excitement and
confusion. The alarm was given. People
thronged the room. Doctors were summoned,
but one look assured them that all
was over with the child.</p>

<p>The Tarara, with trembling limbs and
chattering teeth, threw on some clothes
and drove home in the carriage with
Rhodes, holding the dead child all the way
close pressed against her heart.</p>

<p>Only once did the woman speak to him.
It was when, between them, they had got
the little body up to the tiny room, which
had been its home in life, and had laid it
upon one of the folding-beds, which had
been so neatly made a few hours back.
Then the Tarara, glancing around the poor
place, so purely clean and orderly, taking
in the details here and there—the child’s
slate and lesson books, and her little work-basket,
with its half-used spools of thread
and small brass thimble—and contrasting it
with her own sumptuous rooms and luxurious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
living, turned her gaze upon the man
who stood helpless and miserable in the
midst of this poverty-stricken home, and
said:</p>

<p>“I would have married you for this
child. You should have let me know.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the days when the great West was
still the wild West, many a strange scene
took place before the eye of the gazer,
who had the advantage of two points of
view, and who could get the whole zest of
these primitive conditions, by the process
of contrasting them with a foregone civilization.</p>

<p>Such a one was the man, who had once
been known in the fashionable circles of
an eastern city as William Wilmerding,
but who now, in the mining-camp, went
by the more convenient name of Bill
Will.</p>

<p>He had been a tender-foot when he
first came to the camp, but it was not long
before he hardened to the necessary state
of roughness and toughness, to make him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
acceptable to his companions and approved
mining standards, and at last he became
a prime favorite with the spirited and desperate
fellows, who knew but the savage
and seamy side of life, but who yet had
something in them which responded to
the charm of education and refinement,
when properly repudiated and concealed.</p>

<p>For Bill, in his dress and in his daring
deeds, was as tough and wild as any of
them; indeed, there was a spirit of desperation
in the man, which more than
once had roused the admiration of the
camp, in times of danger, and which had
its source in a certain feeling in William
Wilmerding’s heart, which was his life
secret—a secret which he had come to
bury in this strange new existence. Nothing
but despair of his heart’s desire
would have brought and kept him here.</p>

<p>Every camp in those days had its own
pet pursuit, and in this one it was horse-racing.
Their track was not as smooth
as civilization would have made it, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
that very reason better horses and better
riders were required. Every spring and
autumn they had a grand race-day, and the
purses put up were so large, and the private
betting was so reckless, that big sums of
money were exchanged, and often the rich
became poor, and the poor rich. These
men had no families dependent upon them,
and when once their blood was up, they
did not hesitate to risk their last cent.</p>

<p>On the occasion of one of the spring
races, the bustle and excitement were at
their very height, and the most important
race of the day was about to be run, when
there drove into the field a wagon, in
which were seated two such strange and
alien-looking figures, that even the exciting
demands of the present moment gave
place, for a little while, to this new influence.
The cart was driven by a hale
and hearty old man, who looked impressively
proud of his mission, and who was
lifted so far above mining etiquette as to
take off his hat to the assembled horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
racers, as he brought his cart to a standstill.
It was probably, however, reverence for
his passengers that led to this “break.”</p>

<p>The passengers were two gray-clad,
white-bonneted sisters of charity, who
looked about them, on this alien scene,
with mild-eyed wonder. One of them was
stout, middle-aged, and homely, with energy
and resolution written on every line
of her face. The other was small, and
young, and fair.</p>

<p>As the cart halted, the old man got up
and announced that the sisters had come
up from the mission, two hundred miles
away, to ask for contributions toward the
building of an orphanage, of which there
was pressing need.</p>

<p>His speech was listened to with the
politest attention by the crowd, a few
men, here and there, being so far affected
as to take off their hats in a shame-faced
sort of way, and then confusedly to put them
on again. The two sisters said nothing,
but their mere presence there, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
about them with placid kindly faces that
carried a message of pure goodness to
every heart, so impressed the camp that,
for the moment, the zest about the coming
race seemed in danger of eclipse.</p>

<p>This peril was perceived by one of the
crowd, a tough and wiry little old man
known as Jerry, who had great influence
in the camp, and he now pushed his way
to the front, and jumping on an upturned
box, addressed the assemblage in lusty
tones. Jerry was not altogether temperate
in his habits, and his face and manner, to-day,
indicated an ardor and excitement not
wholly to be attributed to the coming
great race. He was in the highest good
humor, however, and his face fairly
kindled, as he said:</p>

<p>“Time for the race, boys! Clear the
track! Never you mind, old girl,” to the
elder of the sisters. “You’re all right.
Pull off to one side there, driver, and let
the sisters watch the race; and if Whirlwind
wins it, we’ll give the old girl a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
send-off that’ll make her heart jump out
of her body.”</p>

<p>The crowd answered with a cheer, and
the current of interest was again turned
toward the race track, down which Whirlwind,
ridden by Bill Will, was now returning
from a gentle preliminary canter.
Bill Will had been at the other side of the
course when the sisters had arrived, and
now, as he rode up to the starting-point,
his eyes rested on these strange figures for
the first time.</p>

<p>As they did so, he turned deadly white,
and his body swayed in the light saddle, so
that he almost lost his balance—a fact
noticed, perhaps, by but one being in all
that crowd, for, to the miners, a man
amounted to little, beside a horse, on this
day, and they were all gazing eagerly at
Whirlwind to see if he looked in condition.</p>

<p>The person who saw only the man, and
who had no consciousness of the horse, was
the younger of the two sisters. Her face
had turned as white as his, and now, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
the attention of all the rest was fixed upon
the horse, her glance met that of the rider,
with a gaze of mutual consciousness.</p>

<p>She saw him struggle to right himself,
and to regain his self control, and she
heard him say faintly that his throat was
dry. A dozen flasks were hurriedly jerked
from pockets, and held out to him.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “water!” and, at the
sound of his voice, the little sister turned
from white to burning red.</p>

<p>A man ran quickly and brought him
some water in a tin cup. Before he took
it, he removed his cap, and as he bent to
drink, he looked again into the little sister’s
eyes, as if he pledged her thus, in silence.</p>

<p>Then, with a powerful rallying of his
forces, he drew in Whirlwind’s reins, and
settled himself in his saddle, and with a
low bow that might have graced a knight
at a tournament, but which no one here
noticed, or would have comprehended, he
took his place with the other horses at the
starting-point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>There was mad riding that day. The
camp had hitherto seen nothing like it.
The men from neighboring camps, who
had entered fine horses upon which they
had staked all their earthly possessions,
had gone in to win, and were resolved that
Whirlwind should not have this race, if
grit in man and beast could prevent it.
Every horse was strained to its extremest
powers, and every rider rode with a conscious
risk of neck and limb, but if the
others did the utmost possible, it seemed
as though Whirlwind and his rider did the
impossible.</p>

<p>Every eye was so strained upon that
break-neck rush around the course, that a
spectator was very sure of escaping observation;
so no one saw the little sister’s
face. Even the motherly old creature at
her side was peering eagerly through her
steel-rimmed spectacles, not in any absorption
in the race, but in dire anxiety for
the life and limbs of those reckless men.</p>

<p>One man, in truth, was thrown and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
stunned, one noble horse out-strained himself
and broke a blood-vessel, but Whirlwind’s
rider, who had been the boldest
there, came in unscathed, and Whirlwind
won the race.</p>

<p>And then began a whooping and cheering
that made the place a pandemonium,
which even the unwonted feminine presence
in their midst could not keep in
abeyance. Gold and silver, flowing like
water, passed from hand to hand, making
some rich, and others poor; for in the camp
such indebtednesses were settled on the
instant, and no man shirked.</p>

<p>When accounts were apparently squared,
Jerry, wild with enthusiasm, sprang up in
front of the cart in which the sisters sat,
and shouted lustily:</p>

<p>“Our horse has won the race! Hurrah
for Whirlwind and Bill Will!”</p>

<p>When the cheer had been repeated to
the echo, Jerry, taking fresh breath, went
on:</p>

<p>“And hurrah for the sisters and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
orphans, too, I say! March up here,
every mother’s son of you, and ante up
half your winnin’s for the orphans! Here
you are, old girl,” he said, throwing a big
handful of gold into her lap. “That’s half
of my pile, and if ever you tackle an
orphan o’ mine, teach it to bet its last
dollar on the winnin’ horse! Come ahead,
boys! Every last one o’ you throw in
half your pile, and the devil take the one
that refuses!”</p>

<p>For the next five minutes, the gold and
silver coins fell like pouring hailstones
into the old sister’s ample lap, and while
this was going on, Bill Will, with quiet,
stealthy footsteps, approached the cart
from the other side, and poured his contribution
into the lap of the younger sister.
Those who noticed it were not aware that
it was not the half, but the whole of his
winnings, of which he so disposed. Nor
did they notice that, among the coins, was
a little woodland flower, which he had
stooped and gathered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>This small and worthless offering was
not wholly overlooked, however, for before
she turned over her rich tribute of gold to
her companion, the little sister took the
flower and hid it in the folds of her gray
gown—an action that was clearly seen
by one.</p>

<p>Presently the old man stirred up his
drowsy horse, and the cart began to move.
He had thanked the crowd for their generous
charity, in the name of the sisters,
whose order did not permit them such
public speech.</p>

<p>The men stood watching the departure
of the cart with a certain wistfulness. The
sight of these good women had roused
them to unwonted musings. But of the
tragedy taking place beneath their eyes,
they had no imagination—for in that moment,
a man and a woman who had loved
with the supreme passion of their hearts,
and who had been separated by an inexorable
fate, had looked their last into each
other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“There are witty bits of sayings by the score, and sometimes whole

‘Scotland, the country that takes its name from the whisky made
there,’ and the transposed proverb like: ‘It is an ill wind for the shorn

are brilliant. ‘Most of us would never be heard of were it not for our

<p>“Mr. Le Gallienne is first of all a poet, and these little essays,
which savor somewhat of Lamb, of Montaigne, of Lang, and of Birrell,
are larded with verse of exquisite grace. He rarely ventures into the
grotesque, but his fancy follows fair paths; a certain quaintness of
expression and the idyllic atmosphere of the book charm one at the

is a novel of intense and continued interest, and will
claim a prominent place among the books of the season.</p>

<p>“The cleverness of this periodical has always amply justified its
existence but the careless reader, who has never taken it seriously, will
be surprised to find on turning over the leaves of this volume how very
much more than merely clever it is. It contains examples of some of
the strongest work that is now being done in letters. It represents the
best tendencies of the younger writers of the day, and, seen in bulk,
even its freaks and excentricities are shown to be representative of their
sort, and are present in it because they are representative, and not
because they are freakish.”—<span class="smcap">St. Paul Globe.</span></p>
